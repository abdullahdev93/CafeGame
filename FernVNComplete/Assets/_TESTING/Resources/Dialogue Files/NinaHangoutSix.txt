Narrator "While I was cleaning the cafe, my phone buzzed rhythmically, cutting through the stillness of the late afternoon."
Narrator "When I glanced at my phone, Nina Rossi's name flashed on the screen."
Narrator "I put my phone up to my ear and answered."
[Player Name] "Hey, Nina."
Nina "Hey, you busy?"
[Player Name] "Not really. What's up?"
Nina "Feel like taking a walk with me? Just around town?"
Nina "I have been working my ass off on commissions. I need a break."
[Player Name] "Sure." 
[Player Name] "Where do you want to meet?"
Nina "How about I come to you?"
[Player Name] "That works."
Nina "Great! I'll see you in an hour."

Narrator "I changed into regular clothes and stepped outside the cafe, leaning against the window as I waited for Nina."
Narrator "She wore a fitted olive-green blouse tucked into high-waisted jeans, her long wool coat embroidered with delicate patterns along the cuffs." 
Narrator "A deep crimson scarf draped around her neck, shifting slightly in the wind."
Narrator "The wind played with strands of her auburn hair, sending them dancing around her face before she brushed them behind her ear as she approached."
Narrator "A faint scent of something sweet and strong lingered around her - whiskey, maybe, or a bit of red wine from an afternoon drink?"
Narrator "Typical Nina."
Nina "Ready?" 
Narrator "She asked with a smirk, her tone light."

	-Lead The Way 
		Narrator "I gestured to the street."  
		[Player Name] "Lead the way." 
		Narrator "Nina gave a small nod and started walking ahead." 
		Narrator "We started down the street, falling into an easy pace." 
		[Player Name] "So, what's this about?" 
		Narrator "Nina shrugged casually." 
		Nina "Just felt like going on a walk. Relieve some stress." 
		Nina "Didn't want to be cooped up anymore. Thought I'd drag you along for the fun." 
		[Player Name] "Ah, so I'm the designated entertainment?"
		Narrator "A small smirk tugged at her lips."
		Nina "Something like that." 

	-Something On Your Mind? 
		[Player Name] "Something on your mind?" 
		Narrator "Nina hesitated, looking away before settling on me again." 
		Nina "What? I can't just want to take a walk?" 
		Narrator "She quipped, her voice light, but something about the way she said it felt... Deliberate." 
		[Player Name] "Sure you can." 
		[Player Name] "But I know you, Nina." 
		Narrator "She let out a sigh, shoving her hands into coat pockets."  
		Nina "I don’t know, just needed to get out of my apartment for a bit."
		[Player Name] "Want to talk about it?" 
		Nina "What's there to talk about?" 
		Nina "Let's walk." 
		
	-After you, Milady 
		[Player Name] "After you, Milady." 
		Narrator "Nina rolled her eyes but smirked, giving an exaggerated bow before stepping forward." 
		Nina "You're ridiculous." 
		Narrator "She muttered, but there was a slight chuckle in her voice." 
		Nina "But I like that about you." 
		Narrator "As we walked, the air between us felt a little lighter, playful even." 
		Narrator "Nina suddenly nudged me." 
		Nina "Ever think you'd make a good cavalieri?" 
		[Player Name] "Depends." 
		[Player Name] "Do knights always get the girl?" 
		Nina "Only if they fight dragons... Or maybe some snooty wine critics back in Florence." 
		[Player Name] "What about pretentious art critics?" 
		Nina "Them too." 
		Narrator "She grinned." 
}

Narrator "As we strolled through town, passing familiar storefronts, she smelled fresh pastries." 
Narrator "Nina pointed at a bakery across the street." 
Narrator "We walked up to one of the bakery's windows and looked at the display of goods." 
Narrator "The window was slightly foggy from the warmth inside."
Nina "This place does a decent croissant, but you know what's criminal? Their sfogliatella."
[Player Name] "That bad?"
Nina "You don't understand. Growing up, I was surrounded by the smell of fresh bread and pastries." 
Nina "It was mpossible to walk down the street without getting hit with the scent of warm cornetti or freshly baked focaccia." 
Nina "After school, I'd help my parents around the bakery." 
Nina "I owe all my baking skills to my Nonna." 
Nina "I used to always get the sfogliatella - crunchy, sweet, filled with ricotta. It was perfect." 
Nina "But when I got it here, it tasted... Wrong." 
Nina "Like someone tried to recreate it without really understanding what made it special." 
Narrator "She sighed, shaking her head." 
Nina "It's not just the ingredients - it's the air, the people, the way my dad would joke with the regulars while kneading dough." 
Nina "It's not the same as back home."
Narrator "She sighed wistfully." 
Nina "It doesn't feel the same as sitting outside a café in the piazza, watching the world move while sipping something strong enough to make you believe in miracles."
Nina "I don't even take my time anymore. I just sit down and devour my treat without getting a chance to think."
Nina "And I have grown to prefer that."
Narrator "I chuckled."
[Player Name] "Yeah? What's wrong with thinking?"
Narrator "Nina shrugged."
Nina "Thinking leads to remembering. Remembering leads to trouble." 
Narrator "I glanced at her, watching as her fingers traced absentmindedly over the glass display." 
Narrator "For a moment, I thought she was going to say something else, but instead, she suddenly laughed."
Nina "Dio, ascoltami. I sound like a dramatic old lady reminiscing about the good ol' days." 
Nina "Come on, let's keep moving."
Narrator "She nudged my shoulder and started walking again, but I caught her gaze lingering on the bakery just a moment longer."

Narrator "We passed the arcade, its neon lights flickering right outside its wide-open entrance, inviting anyone in with the flashing lights of claw machines and pulsing sound of game beeps, laughter, and the occasional triumphant cheer." 
Narrator "The sounds of pinball machines and the distinct clatter of arcade buttons filled the air, blending into the electric buzz of nostalgia." 
Narrator "Nina, still ahead of me, slowed her pace, and for a moment, she looked like she was considering stepping in."
Narrator "She sighed, a wistful look flickering across her face."
Nina "I used to spend hours in places like this." 
Nina "Back in Italy, there was this dingy little arcade near my school." 
Nina "My friends and I would sneak off after school and waste all our spare change on this one bubble shooter game."
Narrator "She let out a small chuckle."
Nina "When I first moved here for college, I used to come to this arcade a lot." 
Nina "It was one of the few places that reminded me of home. And..." 
Narrator "She hesitated."
Nina "Joseph and I used to hang out here too."
Narrator "Her voice softened on the last part, like she hadn't meant to say it aloud." 
Narrator "She cleared her throat and picked up her pace, stepping away from the arcade."
Nina "Anyway, it's just a place. Let's keep going."

Narrator "It stayed quiet for a couple of minutes before Nina suddenly asked me something."
Nina "Why did you come to Baywood Springs? 
Nina "Out of all the places, why here?" 
[Player Name] "I wanted to get away from city life back in Northern California." 
[Player Name] "I grew up with everything - luxury, comfort, money - but none of it felt like mine. None of it felt like me." 
[Player Name] "My parents wanted me to follow the same path as them - go to college, get a high-paying career, and buy a big fancy house somewhere, but I wanted something different." 
[Player Name] "Something simple." 
[Player Name] "I wanted my own cafe. They didn't support it, so I left."    
[Player Name] "And I used the money I saved up for five years to move to a small town by the ocean. It was a nice change."  
[Player Name] "Starting over wasn't easy, but at least I have control over my own life now."   
[Player Name] "And honestly, I never really bought into the whole college thing anyway. Feels more like a scam than a guarantee." 
[Player Name] "I know Baywood Springs is small, but it has its charm." 
Narrator "Nina scoffed, kicking a stray pebble down the sidewalk." 
Nina "Yeah, real charming. A town where nothing happens." 
Nina "At least you chose to stay here." 
Nina "I'm stuck here. In Baywood, in America." 
Nina "I used to think the American dream was for anyone willing to work hard, but it turns out, it's more like an exclusive club - for those with the right degrees, the right connections, and enough money to buy their success." 
Nina "Here, it's been nothing but struggles." 

choice 
{ 

	-It's Not About Fitting Into Some Club 
		[Player Name] "The American dream isn't about fitting into some exclusive club. It's about the idea that anyone can find success here in their own way." 
		[Player Name] "Maybe, you just haven't found your version of it yet." 
		Narrator "Nina scoffed, shaking her head, but there was no real bitterness in it." 
		Nina "That sounds like something someone who hasn't been continuously chewed up and spit out by the world would say."
		[Player Name] "Or maybe it's something someone who refuses to let the world define them would say." 
		Narrator "Nina fell quiet for a moment." 
		Narrator "She didn't argue, but I know that she also didn't entirely agree. Instead, she kicked another loose pebble down the sidewalk, deep in thought."

	-I Get It 
		[Player Name] "Yeah, I get it. Sometimes, it feels like no matter how hard you work, the system is rigged." 
		[Player Name] "They say success is more about effort, but really, it's more about access." 
		Narrator "Nina let out a short, humorless laugh." 
		Nina "Finally~, someone who actually sees it for what it is." 
		Nina "Everyone loves to pretend hard work is enough." 
		Nina "But if you weren't born in the right place, with the right last name, or a fat bank account, well, good luck." 
		[Player Name] "You know, it's sad to think about." 
		[Player Name] "Makes you wonder how many people never got their shot to do the things that they wanted to do just because they weren't born to the right people, in the right place, and didn't know the right people." 
		Narrator "Nina nodded." 
		Nina "Yeah." 
		Nina "That's why I stopped believing in fairytales. The world isn't built for dreamers."

	-Looking In The Wrong Places? 
		[Player Name] "Or maybe you're just looking in the wrong places?" 
		[Player Name] "Success isn't just money and status, Nina." 
		[Player Name] "Maybe your dream isn't dead - you just have to find a new way to chase it." 
		Narrator "Nina arched a brow, skeptical but intrigued." 
		Nina "And what? Reinvent myself? Try some new grand idea until I finally get lucky?" 
		[Player Name] "Maybe." 
		[Player Name] "Or maybe, it's about redefining what success means to you." 
		[Player Name] "You don't have to follow their rules - you can make your own. That's what I did." 
		Nina "You make it sound so simple." 
		[Player Name] "It's not." 
		[Player Name] "But what's the alternative? Giving up? I don't see you as someone who gives up easily."  
		Narrator "Nina let out a sigh, somewhere between frustration and reluctant agreement." 
		Nina "Yeah... I guess." 
} 

Narrator "Suddenly, Nina stood quiet for the rest of the walk." 

Narrator "We continued on, reaching Town Square." 
Narrator "The large statue of Mayor Caldwell, the town's founder, loomed over the cobbled plaza." 
Narrator "A few people were scattered around, sitting on benches, some talking, some spending time on their phones, and some simply enjoying the fresh air." 
Narrator "The fountain in the center trickled with steady water, the sound filling the brief silence between us." 
Narrator "Nina stopped for a second, watching the water." 
Nina "You ever just sit here and listen to this?" 
[Player Name] "Not really."
Nina "Me neither. Maybe I should. Feels... Peaceful."
Narrator "I glanced at her, noticing the way her shoulders slumped slightly, the distant look in her eyes." 
Narrator "It wasn't just nostalgia anymore and she wasn't just reminiscing. She was grieving." 
Narrator "The bakery, the arcade, and now the square - it was like she was walking through her past, forcing herself to remember things that she didn't want to let go." 
Narrator "I had been letting her set the pace, letting her walk us through her memories." 
Narrator "But now, I finally had enough and decided to call her out on it." 
[Player Name] "Nina, what's wrong? You have been off since we started this walk." 
Narrator "She let out a sharp sigh, as if debating whether to brush it off or acknowledge it." 
Narrator "Her fingers fidgeted with the hem of her jacket before she finally sighed."
Nina "I don't want to talk about it... Not here."
Narrator "Her voice was quieter now, less sharp."
[Player Name] "All right." 
[Player Name] "Then where?"
Nina "Somewhere else." 

Narrator "The streets began to slope slightly upward as we left the central part of town behind, heading toward the more scenic side." 
Narrator "And before I knew it, we reached a cliffside." 
Narrator "The sun was beginning to set, painting the sky in hues of orange, pink, and violet." 
Narrator "The town stretched below us, a quiet collection of buildings and roads." 
Narrator "Tiny streams of headlights weaved through the roads like distant fireflies, tracing the slow rhythm of life below." 
Narrator "In the distance, beyond the town, the abandoned lighthouse stood resolute on the cliffs." 
Narrator "The ocean shimmered under the dying sunlight, shifting between gold and deep blue as waves rolled gently toward the shore." 
Narrator "It was a simple view, but from up here, it felt almost surreal." 
Narrator "Nina stopped at the edge, her hands stuffed into her pockets as she stared out at the skyline." 
Narrator "She was silent for a long moment as the wind tousled her hair, and for a moment, she looked lost in thought."
Narrator "She pulled a flask from her pocket and took a slow sip, the scent of liquor mixing with the crisp evening air." 
Narrator "Her gaze flickered toward me for the briefest moment before she looked away again, her fingers tightening around the metal like it was the only thing keeping her steady." 
[Player Name] "Nina?" 
Nina "I like coming up here. Just to lose myself." 
Nina "Just to feel like I'm somewhere else for a little while." 
Narrator "I stepped up beside her." 
Narrator "She let out a breath, something heavy leaving her shoulders." 
Nina "Back home, I always thought I'd leave one day, go somewhere bigger, better. I guess I did... But now, I just feel stuck." 
Nina "Here, it's different - quieter, lonelier." 
Nina "I came to Baywood University with this big dream of becoming a famous painter, making a name for myself in the States." 
Nina "Living the American dream." 
Nina "But now? That dream's gone, and without it... I don't know who I'm supposed to be anymore." 
Nina "It's like I lost everything. A romantic future, my chance at doing what I love, my best friend, my parents... Even my Nonna." 
Nina "And now, I don't know where I belong anymore."
Narrator "I watched her, the way her fingers clenched slightly around the flask, the way she kept her eyes on the skyline like it held an answer."

{ 
	-Find A New Purpose 
		[Player Name] "Maybe that just means it's time to find a new purpose. A new way to express yourself." 
		Nina "I don't want a new dream!" 
		Nina "Art is the only thing I have ever wanted to do!" 
		Nina "It's who I am. If I'm not an artist, then what the hell am I?" 
		Narrator "There was an edge in her voice, not anger exactly, but more like frustration - at the world, at herself, maybe even at me for suggesting it." 
		[Player Name] "I'm not saying you should give up on art." 
		[Player Name] "You can still do art, but in a different way." 
		Narrator "She exhaled, shaking her head again, but this time, there was a trace of hesitation." 
		Nina "I don't know... Maybe." 
		[Player Name] "You can start over, like I did." 
		Nina "What if... I don't know how to start over?" 
		[Player Name] "Then you take it one step at a time." 
		[Player Name] "You're not alone in this, Nina. You never are." 
		Narrator "For a second, she just stood there, the wind playing with the loose strands of her hair." 
		Narrator "Then, she sighed and looked back at the skyline." 
		Nina "Maybe you're right." 
		
	-Find Another Way 
		[Player Name] "Maybe there's another way." 
		[Player Name] "Maybe success isn't about following one straight path, but about figuring out how to keep going even when things don't go as planned." 
		Narrator "Nina scoffed, though her expression wasn't entirely dismissive." 
		Nina "Keep going?" 
		Nina "And do what? Try again just to fail all over again?" 
		[Player Name] "You don't know that. Maybe your art wasn't meant to fit into the traditional world of galleries and universities. Maybe you carve your own space." 
		Narrator "She frowned, her fingers tapping idly against the flask in her hands."
		Nina "And what if I don't want to start over? What if I just want what I had?"
		[Player Name] "Then you ask yourself if what you had was really meant for you in the first place."
		Narrator "Nina stared at me for a long moment before finally looking away."
		Nina "That's the problem. I don't know."

	-There's A Reason For Everything
		[Player Name] "Maybe things didn't work out because they weren't supposed to." 
		Narrator "Nina looked at me, confused." 
		[Player Name] "Life has a way of pushing us toward something better, even when it doesn't feel like it."
		Narrator "Nina let out a quiet, tired chuckle."
		Nina "That's a nice sentiment, but it's hard to believe when you're the one constantly getting pushed down."
		[Player Name] "It's not only you. I have felt that way too." 
		[Player Name] "But looking back, I see now that if things had gone the way I wanted and if I kept everything I had, I wouldn't be here." 
		[Player Name] "I wouldn't have my own cafe. I wouldn't be here. We wouldn't have met." 
		Narrator "She gave me a skeptical glance, but there was a flicker of curiosity in her eyes."
		Nina "So you think I should just wait around for life to magically work itself out?"
		[Player Name] "No." 
		[Player Name] "Instead of thinking about this as an ending, start looking at this as a new beginning. You never know where it might lead."
		Narrator "Nina didn't answer right away. She turned back toward the horizon, the sunset casting a soft glow over us." 
		Nina "I don't know if I believe in fate, but... Maybe." 
}

Narrator "She gave me a look, before turning back to the horizon." 
Narrator "She shifted slightly, her fingers now tracing patterns against the railing as she stared out at the town below." 
Narrator "She turned to face me again then looked away." 
Narrator "It was as if she wanted to say something." 
Narrator "And when she finally spoke, her voice was quieter, almost careful." 
Nina "Can I tell you something?"
Narrator "I turned to her, nodding." 
[Player Name] "Of course."
Narrator "Nina's gaze was still on the skyline." 
Nina "I also have been thinking a lot about... Mistakes." 
Nina "About how easy it is to mess everything up and not know if you'll ever fix it."
Nina "And how sometimes... You meet great people who deserve better than what you are." 
Nina "And you wonder if they see it, too. If they'll realize one day that you're not worth sticking around for."
Narrator "Her fingers gripped the railing a little tighter, and for a split second, I thought she was going to say something else, but she just shook her head." 
Narrator "Before I could answer, Nina turned around and spoke again." 
Nina "Forget it." 
Narrator "I'm tired. I think I should head home."
Narrator "I nodded, not pushing for an explanation." 
[Player Name] "All right. I'll walk you back."

Narrator "We made our way down the hill in silence, retracing our steps through the now-darkened streets of Baywood Springs." 
Narrator "The air was cooler, the town quieter." 

Narrator "When we finally reached the front of her apartment building, Nina stopped near the entrance, just standing there." 
Narrator "The soft glow of the streetlamp overhead cast long shadows, illuminating us." 
Nina "Thanks. For tonight." 
Narrator "Before I could say anything, she suddenly stepped forward, grabbing my neck and pulling me into a kiss - a deep, unexpected kiss."
Narrator "For a moment, I just stood there, frozen." 
Narrator "Her lips were warm, tasting faintly of whiskey and something bittersweet."
Narrator "Then, just as suddenly, she pulled away, her cheeks flushed as she stepped back."
Nina "I- Sorry."  
Narrator "She looked away then ran a hand through her hair while making a small, embarrassed laugh." 
Nina "Thanks again."
Narrator "She turned quickly, fumbling with her keys before disappearing into the building, the door slammed and clicked shut."
Narrator "I stood there for a moment, still processing what just happened." 
Narrator "A part of me wanted to call out to her, to ask what that meant - to demand an answer." 
Narrator "But I didn't." 
Narrator "Instead, I just stood there, staring at the closed door of the apartment building."
Narrator "A deep exhale left my lips as I turned, shoving my hands into my pockets and heading down the quiet street."
Narrator "I replayed the day in my head, every conversation, every moment where she hesitated, every glance."
Narrator "We walked through her past - reliving pieces of herself." 
Narrator "And in the end, she kissed me." 
Narrator "I wanted to believe that it was just another impulsive act - longing, desperation, or a fleeting moment of warmth." 
Narrator "But this kiss felt... Different." 
Narrator "I didn't know what it meant." 
Narrator "But I knew one thing - today had changed something between us." 
Narrator "And maybe, just maybe, she had let me in enough to make herself feel a little less lonely."
