Narrator "As I continuously served coffee and treats to various patrons, I found myself lost in the comforting aroma of freshly brewed coffee and freshly baked goods."

Narrator "Today was going well. The café was filled with the gentle hum of conversations while soft and smooth jazzical music played."
Narrator "Some new faces and some familiar faces, but there was one face that stood out - a person I have seen before countless times." 
Narrator "They always sat alone at a table near the counter, engrossed in a book while sipping tea." 
Narrator "Intrigued by their serene and mysterious presence, I decided to take a fifteen-minute break when things got slow to strike up a conversation." 
Narrator "Still in uniform and with a friendly smile, I approached their table."
