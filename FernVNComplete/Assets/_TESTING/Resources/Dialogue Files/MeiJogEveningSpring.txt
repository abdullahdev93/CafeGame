Narrator "The cool evening air filled my lungs as I jogged along the winding path through the town's local park, my breath steady and controlled."
Narrator "The setting sun cast long shadows across the path, painting the sky in deep hues of orange and violet."
Narrator "Crickets had begun their nightly chorus, their rhythmic chirps blending with the steady beat of our footsteps against the pavement."
Narrator "Beside me, Mei jogged with surprising ease, her dark hair bouncing with each step."
Mei "You know, I don't usually do runs."
Narrator "She admitted, shooting me a sideways glance."
Mei "But I guess this isn't the worst way to get the blood going."
Narrator "I smirked, picking up my pace slightly."
Narrator "It's not too late to back out."
Narrator "She scoffed, matching my stride."
Mei "Not a chance."
Narrator "A light breeze carried the scent of night-blooming flowers and cooling earth, refreshing against my skin as the streetlamps flickered in the distance."
Narrator "By the time we slowed to a walk near the far end of the park, a satisfying ache settled in my legs."
Narrator "Mei stretched her arms overhead, letting out an exaggerated groan."
Mei "OK, maybe I'll regret this later... Or maybe I'll just make you get me free tea from your shop to make up for it."
Narrator "I laughed, wiping the sweat from my forehead as my heartbeat gradually returned to normal."
Narrator "Despite the fatigue and aches, I felt stronger, faster."
Narrator "Like my Endurance had just improved."
