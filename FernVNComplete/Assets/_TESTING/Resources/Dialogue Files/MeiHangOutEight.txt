Narrator "A kid's hand shot up." 
Lilith "Yes, Harold?" 
Harlod "Are they dating?" 
Kids "Ooo." 
Narrator "Mei blushed. She shifted slightly, clearly caught off guard by the unexpected question." 
Lilith "Now, now, settle down kids. They're just friends." 
Lilith "And they're here to tell you about their jobs."

Kids "Yeah!" 
Narrator "Mei grabs her guitar from across the room then returns to the front of the class." 
Narrator "She takes a seat." 
Mei "\"In shadows deep where dreams entwine, Lost in whispers of a moonlit shrine, Hearts beating fierce, a darkened sign, Embracing love, this heart of mine.\""  
Mei "\"Love in obsidian, so pure and true, In moonlit nights, I dance with you, Acceptance in darkness, a refuge anew, Freedom in shadows, our spirits imbue.\"" 
Mei "\"Souls in the midnight air, Bound by ties that none can tear, Eyes of ebony, a silent stare, Love's embrace, beyond compare.\"" 
Mei "\"In every whisper, in every sigh, In every tear from a moonlit eye, Love's embrace beneath the sky, In shadows deep, we'll never die.\"" 
Mei "In the abyss where shadows grow, Love's eternal flame, a vibrant glow, Embracing darkness, we let it show, In love, we find our flow." 
Narrator "The class cheered and applauded." 
Mei "Thank you." 
Mei "And if you want to hear our music, come to the upcoming music festival." 
Narrator "Mei looks at me with a thumbs up." 
Mei "[Player Name], you're up." 
Narrator "Hello, everyone. I'm [Player Name]." 
Narrator "I took a breath before telling the kids about Bean Bliss Caf√©." 
Narrator "Some of them seemed intrigued while some of them seemed uninterested." 
Narrator "When I was done, I passed out my business cards." 
Narrator "And don't forget to tell your parents about Bean Bliss." 
Lilith "Fascinating. Anyone have any questions?" 
Narrator "Some kids raised their hands. We were able to answer most of the questions." 
Lilith "All right, class. Get out your Language Arts textbooks and open to page 316." 
Narrator "The kids groaned." 
Lilith "I know, I know, but we have to do it." 
Mei "I think I'll stay and help."

Lilith "She's special to me, and I wouldn't want to see her hurt, not again." 
Lilith "She's been through a lot." 
Narrator "I looked back to all of the things that Mei had confided in me - trauma, heartbreak, and loss." 
Narrator "I understood the weight of what she had been through, I understood her mother's wishes." 
Narrator "I'll try not to, ma'am." 
Narrator "Today, I learned more about Mei and finally had the chance to meet her mother, but now, reflecting on everything, I realized that I need to sort out my feelings for Mei." 
Narrator "As this point, it's evident that she has feelings for me." 
Narrator "To be honest, I suspected her feelings for me for a while now." 
Narrator "I have to truly think about how I feel about her. When the time comes, I want to be prepared to give her an honest answer."
