Narrator "... A Negroni."  
Bartender "Ooh, classy. Coming right up."  
Mei "I'll take a glass of Red Wine."  
Bartender "Coming right up."  

Narrator "As the bartender left to prepare our drinks, I leaned against the counter and shot Mei a sideways glance."  
Narrator "Still loyal to the Red Wine?"  
Mei "She smiled, resting her elbow on the bar."  
Mei "It's rich, smooth, and has depth. Kind of like me."  
Narrator "I smirked."  
Narrator "So what does that say about me ordering a Negroni?"  
Mei "She narrowed her eyes, feigning deep thought."  
Mei "Refined. Complicated. A little dramatic."  
Narrator "I chuckled."  
Narrator "If you say so."  

Narrator "The bartender returned and slid our drinks across the counter."  
Narrator "I picked up the short glass, the ruby-red cocktail catching the light just right."  
Narrator "One sip brought a mix of bitterness from the Campari, smoothness from the vermouth, and the sharp bite of gin." 

Narrator "Mei took a sip of her wine, then looked at me over the rim of her glass."  
Mei "OK, I have got to admit... That drink suits you."  
Narrator "I arched a brow."  
Narrator "Oh? How so?"  
Mei "Despite it's flaws, it's got presence." 
Mei "Doesn't try too hard - but it leaves an impression."  
Narrator "I smiled slowly, setting the glass back down."  
Narrator "That's probably the nicest thing anyone's ever said about a cocktail... Or me."  
Mei "Don't let it go to your head."  

Narrator "The warm light of the bar bathed everything in gold." 
Narrator "Around us, the atmosphere buzzed with quiet chatter and the occasional burst of laughter."  
Narrator "We talked for a while- about everything and nothing." 
Narrator "The kind of conversations that made the time disappear."  

Narrator "Eventually, Mei gave a small stretch and nudged her empty glass forward."  
Mei "All right, Cocktail Lover, I think that's my cue to head out."  
Narrator "I knocked back the last sip of my Negroni and stood up beside her."  
Narrator "Then let me do the gentlemanly thing and walk you home."
