Narrator "When conversing, it's important to maintain eye contact and nod occasionally to show genuine interest." 
Narrator "A subtle gesture, a well-timed nod - small actions that make the other person feel heard."
Narrator "One of the best ways to demonstrate that you're paying attention is to repeat or paraphrase what the other person says." 
Narrator "Not just copying their words, but truly processing their meaning and reflecting it back." 
Narrator "'So what you're saying is...' or 'It sounds like you mean...' These phrases show engagement. They show that you care about their thoughts."
Narrator "Avoid interrupting - let the other person fully express their thoughts and feelings before responding." 
Narrator "Conversations shouldn't be a competition to speak first but rather a rhythm, a natural exchange where both voices have space to be heard."
Narrator "As I continued reading, I started to understand - conversation isn't just about words." 
Narrator "It's about presence, patience, and connection."
