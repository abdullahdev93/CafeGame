Narrator "... A Manhattan."  
Bartender "Classic. Coming right up."  
Mei "I'll take a glass of Red Wine."  
Bartender "Got it."  

Narrator "As the bartender moved to prepare our drinks, I rested my forearm on the counter and glanced at Mei, a small smile playing on my lips."  
Narrator "Red Wine again? Thought I might finally see you branch out."  
Mei "She smirked, brushing her short hair behind her ear."  
Mei "Frequently branching out is for people still searching." 
Mei "I already know who I am." 
Mei "And I already know what I like."  
Narrator "Fair point."  
Narrator "And Red Wine does suit you."  
Mei "She eyed me over the rim of her glass as the bartender slid our drinks across the bar."  
Mei "And you? A Manhattan? That's got old spirit written all over it."  
Narrator "I picked up the glass, the deep amber catching the light as I took a slow sip."  
Narrator "The smooth burn of rye and the hint of sweet vermouth settled in my throat."  
Narrator "There's just something about this one - it hits just right."  
Mei "She swirled her wine, watching me."  
Mei "So you're a speakeasy cocktail lounge kind of guy now?"  
Narrator "Only if you promise to roll your eyes at me every time I say something cool."  
Mei "She laughed softly, taking a sip."  
Mei "Careful, you're dangerously close to being charming."  
Narrator "I raised my glass in mock salute."  
Narrator "Then I'm exactly where I meant to be."  

Narrator "The bar hummed with soft conversation and the clink of glasses." 
Narrator "We talked, losing track of time between sips and shared glances."  
Narrator "The night mellowed around us, but neither of us seemed in a rush to let it end."  
Narrator "Eventually, with a quiet sigh and the final sip of her wine, Mei leaned toward me."  
Mei "All right, classic man. It's getting late. Walk me home?"  
Narrator "I smiled, finishing the last of my Manhattan."  
Narrator "Of course."
