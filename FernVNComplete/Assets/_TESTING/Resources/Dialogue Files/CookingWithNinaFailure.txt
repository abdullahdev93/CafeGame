Narrator "Despite my best efforts, the rice stuck to the bottom of the pot and began to burn." 
Narrator "When Nina returned, her nose wrinkled as she approached the stove."
Nina "Oh no... You burnt it!"
Narrator "I saw the disappointment in her face, then suddenly, it sounded like she was trying to hold back a laugh."
Nina "OK, Plan B." 
Narrator "Plan B turned out to be takeout from a nearby Asian restaurant." 
Narrator "Nina placed the order, and soon we were sitting on the couch with cartons of fried rice, noodles, and dumplings." 
[Player Name] "I am so sorry." 
Nina "It's OK." 
Nina "It's not so bad."  
Narrator "She said, her chopsticks deftly picking up a dumpling." 
Nina "Sometimes you have to improvise when things don't go your way." 
[Player Name] "True." 
Narrator "I admitted, taking a bite of fried rice." 
Narrator "But next time, I'm leaving the risotto to you."
Narrator "I said with slight disappointment, and I'm sure that Nina noticed the pinch of sadness in my tone." 
Narrator "After we finished eating, Nina pulled out her phone, a mischievous smile tugging at her lips as she waved it slightly." 
Nina "I know what would make you feel better." 
Nina "Come on." 
Narrator "She said, standing and motioning for me to follow her." 
Nina "Let's watch TwistTok in my room."
Narrator "I hesitated for a moment, but her enthusiasm was contagious." 
Narrator "We headed to her bedroom, a cozy and cluttered space, with art supplies and canvases stacked against one wall."
Narrator "She flopped onto the bed, patting the spot next to her."
Nina "You have to see this video." 
Narrator "She said, scrolling through her phone." 
Nina "It's hilarious." 
Narrator "I sat down, trying to get comfortable as she played the TwistTok."
Narrator "It was a cat attempting to jump onto a counter and failing spectacularly." 
Narrator "Her laughter was infectious, and soon, I found myself laughing just as hard."
[Player Name] "All right, that one was pretty good."
Nina "Pretty good? That was gold! Wait - this one's even better." 
Narrator "We spent the next hour trading reactions, laughing until our sides hurt." 
Narrator "It felt like we'd known each other forever."
Narrator "At some point, she leaned her head against my shoulder, her laughter softening into a contented sigh."
