Narrator "The scent of garlic sizzling in olive oil filled Nina's apartment as we stood side-by-side in her small kitchen."
Narrator "The counters were cluttered with ingredients - fresh parsley, ripe tomatoes, a wedge of Parmesan, and bottles of olive oil and balsamic vinegar."
Narrator "Nina moved with ease, her paint-splattered shirt swapped for a simple apron, her hair was still loosely tied back."
Nina "Risotto is all about patience." 
Narrator "She stirred the rice in a pot, her tone steady and confident." 
Nina "You can't rush it, and you can't stir it for too long."  
Nina "It's a balancing act - kind of like painting."
[Player Name] "So, cooking is an art too?"
Narrator "I teased, watching the rice absorb the chicken stock she ladled in."
Narrator "She glanced at me, a playful smirk on her lips." 
Nina "Oh, of course."  
Nina "Every dish is a canvas, and every ingredient is a color." 
Nina "You can't just throw anything together and expect it to work."  
Nina "It takes thought, care, and sometimes... Happy little accidents."
[Player Name] "Like burning the onions?" 
Narrator "I teased, gesturing to the pan she had scrapped earlier."
Narrator "She laughed, the sound light and warm." 
Nina "Exactly." 
Nina "But don't remind me of that." 
Nina "Here, try stirring this. I have to pee."
Narrator "I took the wooden spoon from her as she left and began stirring the rice."
