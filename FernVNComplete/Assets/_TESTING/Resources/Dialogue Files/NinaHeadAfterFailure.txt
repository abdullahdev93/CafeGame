		[Player Name] "Thanks for inviting me." 
		Narrator "I began to stand and gather the plates." 
		Nina "You don't have to take the plates." 
		[Player Name] "I insist. After everything you did today, it's the least I can do." 
		Narrator "She walked me to the door, lingering as I stepped into the hallway." 
		Nina "See you soon?" 
		Nina "Maybe, next time we can do more?"
		Narrator "I gave her a small wave before heading out."

		[Player Name] "Wait."

		Narrator "She returned to sitting upright and studied me as if searching for the catch in my words."  
		Nina "You serious?" 
		Narrator "I nodded." 
		Nina "Well, that's... Unexpected. Most people just... Go with it." 
		Nina "Well, that's on me for wanting to be too quick."  
		[Player Name] "Do most people really don't want to get to know you?"  
		Narrator "Her laugh was short, almost bitter, as she tucked a strand of hair behind her ear." 
		Nina "No, not really." 
		Nina "And hookups are easy, you know?" 
		Nina "One time, some asshole just went along with it." 
		Nina "They didn't care about me, just the moment." 
		Nina "I guess I got used to that." 
		Nina "That was during my... Self-destructive phase, after everything that happened with Joseph and Sophia." 
		Nina "Sorry. I don't even know what I was thinking just now."

		Narrator "I rested a hand on her shoulder."  
		[Player Name] "Nina, it's OK." 
		Narrator "She smiled. Then, with a playful nudge to my shoulder, she changed the subject, steering us back to what we were doing." 
		Nina "So, what did you think of the videos?"
		[Player Name] "They were good."  
		Narrator "She straightened up, stretching slightly and brushing her hair back."

		[Player Name] "Thanks for inviting me."

		Nina "See you soon?" 
		Narrator "I gave her a small wave before heading out." 
		Narrator "As I stepped out, the taste of espresso and vanilla still lingered on my tongue." 
		Narrator "Walking out of the apartment building, Nina's laughter still echoed in my mind, her gentle touch a quiet reminder of the trust she had given me." 
		Narrator "What started as a simple invitation to cook and watch a movie had become something more - a shared experience that strengthened our relationship."
