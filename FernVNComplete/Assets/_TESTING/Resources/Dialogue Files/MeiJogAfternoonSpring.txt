Narrator "The warm afternoon air filled my lungs as I jogged along the winding path through the town's local park, my breath steady and controlled."
Narrator "The sun hung low in the sky, casting a golden glow over the trees and stretching our shadows along the pavement."
Narrator "Birds flitted between branches, their chirps mixing with the steady rhythm of our footsteps and the distant laughter of kids playing nearby."
Narrator "Beside me, Mei jogged with surprising ease, her dark hair bouncing with each step." 
Mei "You know, I don't usually do runs." 
Narrator "She admitted, shooting me a sideways glance." 
Mei "But I guess this isn't the worst way to get the blood going." 
Narrator "I smirked, picking up my pace slightly." 
Narrator "It's not too late to back out."
Narrator "She scoffed, matching my stride." 
Mei "Not a chance."
Narrator "The gentle breeze cooled my skin, carrying the fresh scent of blooming flowers and damp earth, invigorating me with every breath."
Narrator "By the time we slowed to a walk near the far end of the park, a satisfying ache settled in my legs." 
Narrator "Mei stretched her arms overhead, letting out an exaggerated groan." 
Mei "OK, maybe I'll regret this later... Or maybe I'll just make you get free tea from your shop to make up for it."
Narrator "I laughed, wiping the sweat from my forehead as my heartbeat gradually returned to normal."
Narrator "Despite the fatigue and aches, I felt stronger, faster."
