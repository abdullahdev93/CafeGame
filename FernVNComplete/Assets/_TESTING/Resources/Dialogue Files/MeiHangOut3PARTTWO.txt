Narrator "I stayed at Mei's place a little longer than expected, the conversation flowing effortlessly as my headache faded."  
Narrator "Between laughter and quiet pauses, I learned pieces of who she was - her passion for music, her love for rainy nights, and her love for collecting old records just to study their imperfections." 

Narrator "Eventually I left, slipped into my car, and began the quiet drive home."
Narrator "On the drive home, I realized her melodies were fragments of feelings she couldn't bring herself to say out loud in normal conversation." 
Narrator "Every lyric, every note carried the same elements: pain, hope, and the struggle to heal." 
Narrator "I thought about how easily she smiled and laughed, how confidently she performed, and wondered how much of that was real." 
Narrator "There was definitely more to Mei than she let on." 
Narrator "But do I want to know?"
Narrator "Would I think of her differently when I know her completely?"

Narrator "The thought lingered throughout the drive."
