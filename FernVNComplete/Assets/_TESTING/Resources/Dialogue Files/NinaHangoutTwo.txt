Narrator "I walked into the bar, just expecting to get a few drinks - something simple to end the day - when I saw a familiar face in the corner."
Narrator "It took a second, but there was no mistaking it."
Narrator "It was Nina."
Narrator "She was hunched over in the booth, her fingers resting on a sketchpad. A half-finished drink sat beside her."
Narrator "The warm amber lighting caught strands of her auburn hair, making them shimmer slightly."
Narrator "Her hair was tied in a loosely made bun, like it was made in a rush - casual, careless, and just a bit crooked."
Narrator "And her red scarf was knotted too tightly around her neck, almost as if she were holding herself together with it."
Narrator "I approached her slowly, unsure if she'd remember me."
FirstName "Hey."
Narrator "I said casually, as I sat in her booth, across from her."
Narrator "She didn't look up."
Nina "Didn't expect to see you here again."
FirstName "Same. Must be fate."
Narrator "Nina snorted but didn't smile." 
Nina "Sure." 
Narrator "Her voice was steady, detached."
Nina "Do you need something?"
Narrator "I hesitated, watching her draw with quick, messy lines."
Narrator "Her pencil moved with practiced precision."

	Narrator "She sighed."
	Nina "Look, I usually don't do repeats."
	Nina "One night, no strings. That's my rule."
	Narrator "She wasn't harsh about it - just matter-of-fact. Like someone reciting a boundary they'd said countless times before."
	Nina "And it was one night of casual sex. It didn't mean anything."
	FirstName "I wasn't looking for more action. Just thought I'd say hello." 
	Narrator "She took a sip of her whiskey and tapped the rim twice before speaking."
	Nina "Well, that was nice of you. You said your hello. Now you can go."

	Narrator "Then, quietly - almost grudgingly - she nodded."
	Nina "Well... I'm still here." 
	Narrator "She took a sip of her whiskey and tapped the rim twice before speaking."

	-Order A Non-Alcoholic Drink [condition: $PlayerStats.Courage > 2]  
		Narrator "Instead of leaving, I waved the bartender over." 
		FirstName "Ginger ale, please."
		Bartender "Ya got it."
		Narrator "She glanced up slightly, her eyes narrowing."
		Nina "You're not drinking?"
		FirstName "Just wanted to start with something non-alcoholic."
		Narrator "Nina looked back down at her sketchbook, but her pencil didn't move right away." 
		Nina "This isn't the kind of place you come to stay sober."
		FirstName "Maybe not."
		FirstName "But maybe I'm not here for the place."
		FirstName "Maybe I'm here for the people."
		FirstName "Maybe I'm here for you."
		Narrator "Her pencil paused."
		Nina "You don't know me."
		FirstName "Not yet."
		Nina "You don't want to know me."
		Narrator "She didn't say it with edge or anger."
		Narrator "She said it like a warning. Like someone who'd been burned too many times and was just trying to save me from the smoke."
		Narrator "I didn't flinch. I just looked at her and said nothing, and maybe that silence said more than any clever line could."
		Narrator "Her eyes flicked up for the briefest second before she groaned quietly, flipping to a new page in her sketchpad."
		Nina "God, you're persistent."
		FirstName "I've been called worse."
		Narrator "Nina smirked, but it didn't quite reach her eyes."
		Nina "That doesn't surprise me. You strike me as someone who collects insults like bottle caps." 
		Narrator "She returned to drawing as I got my drink and sipped it." 
		Narrator "We sat in silence for a while, the hum of the bar filling the space between us - low laughter, a clinking glass, a tired voice asking for another round, and a country song playing faintly in the background."
		Narrator "Eventually, she looked up, her eyes meeting mine with something that resembled curiosity, or maybe just resignation."
		Nina "Why are you so interested in me?"
		FirstName "You seem lonely."
		Nina "Maybe I like to be left alone?"
		FirstName "If that were really true, you wouldn't be at a bar."
		FirstName "You'd be alone at home, drinking with nobody watching."
		Narrator "She didn't say anything at first. Her eyes drifted back to the sketchpad, but her pencil didn't move."
		Nina "Maybe I just like noise around me?"
		FirstName "Even if it comes from strangers?"
		Nina "Strangers are easier. They don't ask too many questions. They don't pretend to care."
		FirstName "I'm not pretending."
		Narrator "She let out a slow exhale and reached for her drink again, swirling the ice with a faint clink."
		Narrator "Then she looked at me - really looked at me."
		Nina "You're weird, you know that?"
		FirstName "I guess I am."
		Nina "But you're... Not the worst company tonight. I guess."

	-Order Her Drink [condition: $PlayerStats.Charisma > 4] 
		Narrator "I glanced at her half-empty glass, then caught the bartender's eye and gave a subtle wave."
		FirstName "One margarita, and whatever whiskey she had - a round for both of us."
		Bartender "Comin' right up."
		Narrator "Nina's hand paused mid-sketch. Her fingers curled slightly over the pencil, and she looked up, eyes narrowing with quiet suspicion."
		Nina "You didn't have to do that."
		FirstName "I know."
		Narrator "The bartender placed the drinks on the table with a soft clink, and Nina stared at her whiskey like it was some kind of riddle."
		Nina "Nice try."
		Narrator "Her tone wasn't angry, but layered - half-defensive, half-curious."
		Nina "Most people would take that as an excuse to flirt."
		Nina "Or assume they've earned something."
		FirstName "I'm not most people."
		Narrator "She studied me for a long moment."
		Nina "You don't know me."
		FirstName "Not yet."
		Nina "You don't want to know me."
		Narrator "She didn't say it with edge or anger."
		Narrator "She said it like a warning. Like someone trying to protect you from something."
		Narrator "I didn't flinch. I just looked at her and said nothing."
		Narrator "And maybe that silence said more than any clever line could."
		Narrator "Her eyes flicked up for the briefest second before she groaned quietly, flipping to a new page in her sketchpad. The motion felt like surrender."
		Nina "God, you're persistent."
		Narrator "She sighed, but this time it wasn't annoyed."
		Nina "Fine."
		Nina "You bought me a drink. Thanks. Doesn't mean I have to like you."
		FirstName "Didn't ask you to."
		FirstName "I'm just a weird person looking to be nice."
		Narrator "Her lips twitched, almost smiling."
		Narrator "She picked up the whiskey, studied it for a moment like it might reveal something, then quietly lifted the glass toward me."
		Nina "Well, to weird choices and strange company." 
		Narrator "I lifted my glass." 
		FirstName "Cheers."
		Narrator "We clinked glasses."

	-Leave
		Narrator "I gave her a soft smile, then slid out of the booth without saying another word."
		Narrator "She didn't look up, but her pencil moved slower - less certain, like her thoughts were somewhere else now."
		Narrator "As I walked away, the sounds of the bar seemed to rise - laughter, the clinking of bottles, and low conversations braided through country music." 
		Narrator "Something made me turn." 
		Narrator "She was still there, curled into the corner of the booth but her eyes were on me. Just for a second."
		Narrator "And when she realized I'd caught her, she looked away quickly. Her attention snapping back to her sketchpad."
		Narrator "I walked toward a stool at the counter and slid into it."

}

Narrator "A couple of drinks in - some alcoholic, some not - we eased into a rhythm, starting to have a genuine conversation."
Narrator "We drifted through music tastes, favorite books, weird jobs we'd had, and jokes that didn't always land but still somehow made us laugh."
Narrator "She even admitted, half-grinning, that she liked horror movies but couldn't watch them alone."
Narrator "Eventually, Nina set her pencil down."
Narrator "The scratch of graphite stopped and she closed her sketchbook with a soft thud." 
Narrator "She leaned back in the booth, eyes unreadable, and rested her hands close together on the table - fingertips tapping idly, like she was building up to something."
Nina "All right, I want an honest answer."
Nina "What do you really think of me?"
Nina "When we first met... I wasn't exactly charming. I was cold, maybe rude, definitely drunk."
Nina "So tell me - what made you want to stick around? What made you think I was worth even trying to get to know? Seriously. I wanna know."  

choice "..." 
{ 
	-You Seem Sad
		FirstName "Because you seemed sad." 
		FirstName "The kind of sadness that lingers behind someone's eyes when they think no one's looking." 
		FirstName "I took a psych class in college - just as an elective - and one thing that stuck with me was how people often give themselves away in the smallest ways." 
		FirstName "You didn't seem broken... Just like someone caught between wanting to be invisible and secretly hoping someone would notice them." 
		Narrator "Nina didn't respond immediately. Her fingers traced the rim of her glass, slow and deliberate."
		Nina "... You're really not good at small talk, are you?" 
		FirstName "Never claimed to be." 
		Narrator "She let out a short, dry laugh, then glanced away."
		Nina "Still... You might not be wrong." 
		Narrator "She didn't add anything after that." 
		Narrator "Instead, she changed the subject." 
		Nina "Wait. You went to college and now work at a cafe?" 
		FirstName "Never said I graduated." 

	-You Were Real, Honest
		Narrator "I leaned forward slightly, elbows resting on the table, meeting her eyes."
		FirstName "Because you were real. Honest. You didn't pretend to be anything you weren't. You didn't sugarcoat things." 
		FirstName "I like that." 
		FirstName "Most people put on a mask, but you didn't." 
		Narrator "She raised an eyebrow, somewhere between amused and skeptical." 
		Nina "So being a bit of a mess is now an endearing quality now?"    
		FirstName "No." 
		FirstName "But being honest about it? That's rare. It says a lot about a person."    
		Narrator "For a moment, she didn't speak." 
		Narrator "Then she gave a faint, crooked smile." 
		Nina "Guess that's one way to stand out." 
		Narrator "Then, slowly, she relaxed back into the booth." 

	-You Look Like Someone People Overlook Too Quickly
		FirstName "You look like someone people overlook too quickly." 
		FirstName "Someone who's used to people not taking enough time to get to know them - being misread, misunderstood, or just ignored."    
		Narrator "She stiffened - just slightly. The kind of pause that wasn't fear, but something else." 
		Nina "That's... Presumptuous." 
		Nina "I don't know whether to roll my eyes or actually believe you." 
		FirstName "I'm fine with either." 
		FirstName "Just know I meant it." 
		Narrator "She shook her head slowly, but there was a smile tugging at her lips." 
		Nina "You're such a weirdo."
		FirstName "Yeah, but I'm your weirdo - for the night, at least." 
		Narrator "She laughed then. Finally, genuinely laughed." 
} 

Narrator "We stayed like that - drinking, talking in bursts, and stayed in silence - the hours sliding by unnoticed." 
Narrator "At some point, Nina pulled out her phone and turned the screen toward me, showing her number."
Nina "Here." 
Nina "In case I ever... Want company again." 
Narrator "I chuckled and saved it, trying not to read too much into it." 
Narrator "But something about the way she offered it - seemed a little awkward, like she wasn't used to giving people her number." 
Narrator "A soft buzz vibrated across the table as a notification appeared on her screen." 
Narrator "Nina glanced at the screen, her expression shifting." 
Nina "My rideshare is here." 
Narrator "She stood up, slipping her phone into her pocket and grabbing her sketchbook, carefully sliding it into her satchel."  
Narrator "But before turning away, she lingered for just a moment."     
Narrator "Her eyes met mine again."  
Nina "I'll see you around." 
Narrator "I watched her walk out the door, the bar lights casting a soft gold outline across her scarf and shoulders." 
Narrator "And just like that - a new friendship had blossomed." 
Narrator "I smiled to myself then finished the last sip of my drink before heading out into the night."
