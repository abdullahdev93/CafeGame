		Narrator "The warm afternoon air filled my lungs as I jogged along the winding path through the town's local park, my breath steady and controlled."
		Narrator "Golden sunlight streamed through some of the trees and casted long shadows over the sunbaked grass."
		Narrator "Birds chirped lazily, their songs mingling with the distant laughter of kids playing and the rhythmic patter of my footsteps against the pavement."
		Narrator "A light breeze offered a brief chill from the lingering heat, carrying the scent of blooming flowers."
		Narrator "By the time I slowed to a walk near the far end of the park, a satisfying ache settled in my legs."
		Narrator "I wiped the sweat from my forehead as my heartbeat gradually steadied."
		Narrator "Despite the fatigue and aches, I felt stronger, faster."
		Narrator "Like my Endurance had just improved."
