		Narrator "I brushed a stray lock of hair from her face, my fingers lingering against her soft skin as I gently cupped her left cheek."  
		Narrator " We leaned in simultaneously and our lips softly met." 
		Narrator "It was just a duck-lipped kiss, but it evolved into a deep and passionate kiss." 
		Narrator "Nina wrapped her arms around me while our tongues swirled, pulling me closer every few seconds, feeling her breast cushion my body."  
		Narrator "Without breaking our embrace, Nina began to move backward, leading me into toward her bedroom."  
		Narrator "We tumbled onto the bed, breaking the embrace." 
		Narrator "Nina got on top of me, her hands finding the hem of her shirt, pulling it over her head effortlessly, exposing her smooth-cup underwire white bra." 
		Narrator "Before I knew it, our clothes were off, forgotten on the floor."

		Narrator "She leans, her face close to mine."
		Narrator "I should leave." 
		Narrator "She retracts." 
		Nina "You sure?" 
		Narrator "I nodded." 
		Nina "All right." 
		Narrator "As I'm walking out, I quickly turn around to face her."
