Narrator "I laid on my bed, scrolling through videos on my phone."
Narrator "Then my phone buzzed, and Nina's name flashed across the screen."
Narrator "I accepted the call and put the phone against my ear."
Nina "Hey, [Player Name], I worked my ass off on commissions all week, and I made a killing~."
[Player Name] "Woah. That's great, Nina."
[Player Name] "Plan to celebrate?"
Nina "That's why I'm calling."
Nina "Want to come with me to the bar and celebrate?"
Narrator "I could hear the excitement in her Italian accent, but a familiar sense of unease curled in my stomach."
Narrator "I know that Nina likes to use alcohol as a way to cope, a way to drown out emotions that she didn't want to face."
Narrator "I hesitated, gripping my phone a little tighter."
[Player Name] "Nina, I'm happy for you but you're not just using this as an excuse to get drunk, are you?"
Nina "No, I just want to celebrate with my buddy and unwind with a couple of drinks."
Narrator "I hesitated again."
Narrator "Still, I sighed, pushing aside my doubts."
Narrator "Maybe tonight would be different."
[Player Name] "All right, but take it easy on the drinks."
Nina "Yes, of course, right. Just a couple, I swear."
[Player Name] "You promise?"
Nina "See you soon~!"
Narrator "She said, very quickly before hanging up the phone."
Narrator "Nina's enthusiasm felt forced, like she was trying to convince herself as much as me."
Narrator "I could just hear it in the way she spoke."
Narrator "Or maybe I'm just overthinking things."
Narrator "I got up and walked to the bar."

Narrator "Now standing outside the bar, I folded my arms while waiting for Nina."
Narrator "Eventually, I saw Nina approaching, her stride confident but almost too eager, like she was running toward something - or away from something."
Narrator "Before I could say a word, she grabbed my wrist swiftly and yanked me inside.
Nina "Drinks on me~!"
Narrator "There was something electric about her energy, but it carried an undercurrent of something restless, something uneasy."
Narrator "Nina  weaved us through the crowd with ease."
Narrator "Country music played in the background, drowned by the hum of conversation and clinking glasses."
Narrator "Nina slid onto a barstool, barely waiting for me to settle into my seat before waving down the bartender."
Narrator "The bartender gave her a knowing nod and poured two glasses of whiskey then slid them across the counter toward us."
Narrator " smiled and lifted her glass to me."
Nina "Cheers!"
Narrator "Our glasses met with a soft clink, and I took a slow sip, letting the whiskey burn lightly down my throat."
Narrator "Nina, on the other hand, tilted her head back and downed hers in one swift motion, the amber liquid disappearing almost instantly."
Narrator "She set the empty glass down with a sharp clatter, already signaling the bartender for three more glasses before I had even placed my glass back on the counter."
Narrator "She downed one drink after another, the amber liquid vanishing as quickly as it was served to her."

	-Slow Down
		Narrator "I reached out and placed a hand on Nina's wrist as she reached for yet another drink."
		[Player Name] "Nina, slow down."
		[Player Name] "You promised you'd take it easy."
		Narrator "She let out a laugh, pulling her hand back and downing the whiskey anyway."
		Nina "Relax, tesoro, I can handle myself."
		Narrator "She slurred, her accent thickening."
		[Player Name] "It's not about that."
		[Player Name] "I just... I don't want you to regret this."
		Narrator "She scoffed, leaning against the bar."
		Nina "Regret? Please." 
		Narrator "Her voice was bitter and her smile thin."
		Narrator "Before I could say anything else, she was already flagging the bartender down for another round."
		
	-You Sure Are Thirsty
		Narrator "I let out a low whistle, watching as Nina signaled for yet another drink."
		[Player Name] "You sure are thirsty tonight."
		Narrator "She grinned at me, though it didn't quite reach her eyes."
		Nina "What can I say? When celebrating, either you go big or go home."
		[Player Name] "Celebrating or escaping?"
		Narrator "I asked, tilting my head."
		Narrator Her smile fell for the briefest moment before she shrugged.
		Nina "Can't it be both?"
		Narrator "She lifted her glass, taking a sip this time, a long sip, eyes flickering to the side."
		Nina "You're overthinking it, [Player Name]."
		Nina "Just enjoy the drinks."
		Narrator "I wanted to argue, but knowing Nina - she'd just deflect until I let it go."

	-You OK?
		Narrator "As Nina continued to down another whiskey, her fingers tightening around the glass like she needed something to hold onto."
		[Player Name] "Nina, you OK?"
		Narrator "She stilled for just a moment, as if the question had caught her off guard."
		Narrator "Then she let out a breathy laugh, shaking her head."
		Nina "Oh, sure. Never better."
		Narrator "She said, her voice dripping with sarcasm."
		Narrator "I didn't laugh."
		[Player Name] "I mean it, Nina. You don't seem like yourself."
		Narrator "She swirled the liquid in her glass, staring into it like it held some kind of answer."
		Nina "This is who I am. You know that."
		Narrator "Before I could say anything else, she knocked back the rest of her drink."
		Narrator "She slurred, her Italian accent becoming thicker with each shot."

[Player Name] "Nina, how have you been? Has everything been OK lately?"
Narrator "She waved a dismissive hand, eyes flickering toward the bar shelves."
Nina "Fine. Busy. You know how it is."
Narrator "She said quickly and lightly, but her fingers drummed against the table, a nervous tick."
[Player Name] "How many commissions did you work on?"
Nina "Oh, I just finished ten this week."
Narrator "She then let out a short laugh, swirling the drink in her glass before downing it."
Nina "Yeah, commissions have been good. No complaints." 
Narrator "But it was noticeable that there was something on her mind." 
Narrator "The words came too easily, giving me fake smile each time." 
Narrator "Every time I tried to steer the conversation toward something deeper, she gave me vague, short responses or drowned a glass of whiskey."
Narrator "As the night stretched on, we continued to drink together, but Nina started to become less lively and quiet."
Narrator "Nina eventually stopped downing her drinks and I watched her dangled her glass, gripping it like a claw machine."
Narrator "She sighed."
Nina "[Player Name], have you ever felt like you're just... Pretending to be OK?"
[Player Name] "Sometimes"
Narrator "I hesitated, sliding my finger around the rim of my glass."
[Player Name] "Sometimes."
Narrator "Nina let out a dry laugh, shaking her head."
Nina "Right? It's exhausting." 
Narrator "She sighed, her gaze fixed on the counter."
Nina "Some days, I feel like I'm playing the part of a care-free girl."
Nina "Everyone expects you to be fine all the time, so I pretend there and then."
[Player Name] "The world doesn't care when you're upset." 
Narrator "She tapped her fingers against her glass, her expression distant." 
Nina "Yeah."
Narrator "For a moment, we just sat there."
Narrator "She looked at me, her eyes searching for something - maybe more validation? Maybe just the comfort of knowing she wasn’t the only one that felt like this?" 
Nina "I'm sorry for dragging you here." 
Nina "I should go." 
Nina "Alone." 
Nina "Thanks for coming with me." 
Narrator "I watched her stumble out the door." 
Narrator "Later that night,  I drove to Nina's apartment, parked, and entered the building." 
Narrator "Now, I was outside her front door, shifting my weight from one foot to the other." 
Narrator "I had to figure out what exactly was wrong." 
Narrator "I knocked on the door." 
Narrator "The door creaked open slightly, the dim light from inside spilling onto the hallway floor." 
Narrator "Puzzled, I knocked again, but there was no response." 
Narrator "Concerned, I pushed the door open and stepped inside the apartment." 
Narrator "The apartment was dimly lit, with only the glow from a small lamp in the corner." 
Narrator "The air was thick with the scent of alcohol, an acrid mixture of whiskey and something fruitier." 
Narrator "Empty cans and bottles lined the coffee table, one was knocked over, its contents staining the surface. 
Narrator "By the looks of it, she continued to drink when she got home." 
Narrator "The faint hum of a record player spun in the background, though the song had long since ended, leaving only the scratch of static." 
Narrator "Then I saw her." 
Narrator "Nina was slouched on the couch, one leg dangling off the side, the other curled below her." 
Narrator "She was wearing an oversized shirt that slipped off one shoulder, paired with soft cotton shorts - but her makeup was smudged, her eyeliner streaked as though she had rubbed her eyes carelessly." 
Narrator "A half-empty bottle dangled from her fingers." 
[Player Name] "Nina?" 
Narrator "I called softly, stepping closer." 
Narrator "She stirred but didn’t look up." 
Nina "Mmm, go 'way." 
Nina "I don't want you to see me like this." 
Narrator "She slurred, waving a finger in my direction before letting her entire hand flop onto the curled leg."  
Narrator "I sighed, crouching down beside her."

	-We All Do 
		Narrator "I let out a small sigh." 
		[Player Name] "We all do, Nina. Everyone pretends." 
		Narrator "She scoffed, swirling the whiskey in her glass before taking a sip." 
		Nina "That's comforting and depressing at the same time." 
		Narrator "I gave her a small smile." 
		[Player Name] "It just means you're not alone." 
		Narrator "Nina exhaled, rubbing her temple." 
		Nina "I don't know." 
		Nina "Sometimes, it feels like I'm the only one who's bad at pretending." 
		Nina "Like I'm the only one who can't hold it together." 
		[Player Name] "You don't have to hold it together all the time." 
		[Player Name] "We all have our moments of weakness." 
		[Player Name] "No one is perfect." 
		[Player Name] "Whoever made you think you have to be fine all the time can kiss my ass."

		[Player Name] "No."

		Narrator "Nina blinked at me, her expression shifting - first confusion, then something closer to irritation." 
		Nina "Oh?" 
		Nina "So you have got it all figured out, huh?" 
		Narrator "I leaned forward, steadying my voice." 
		[Player Name] "Not all of it, but I try to find ways to cope in a way that doesn't leave me wrecked the next morning." 
		[Player Name] "I know it's not easy but numbing yourself doesn't really solve the issue."

Nina “There’s nothing to talk about.”
[Player Name] “You're drinking a lot more than usual. That's not nothing.” 
Narrator "She scoffed, shaking her head again." 
Narrator "She rubbed at her temples, exhaling sharply." 
Nina "You don’t get it, do you? Some people just... Deal with things differently.”
[Player Name] “By drinking themselves into oblivion?” 
Nina “By making it stop, OK!” 
[Player Name] She shot back, her voice nearly cracking as she sat up and pulled her knees up to her chest, wrapping her arms around them. 
Nina "To numb the pain." 
Nina "Numb... The grief." 
Nina "She squeezed her eyes shut, her grip on the bottle loosening." 
[Player Name] "Grief? Nina, what happened?" 
Narrator "Nina signed." 
Narrator "She began to sop."  
Nina "They called me today." 
[Player Name] "Who did?" 
Narrator "She swallowed hard." 
Nina "My parents." 
Narrator "Her lips twisted into bitterness." 
Nina "After years of silence." 
Narrator "She let out a humorless laugh, shaking her head." 
Nina "I thought maybe... Maybe they were reaching out to apologize."  
Narrator "She exhaled sharply, fingers gripping the fabric of her shirt." 
Nina "But no~."   
Nina "They only called to tell me that my nonna is dead." 
Nina "It never stops. The thoughts. The memories. The guilt. It just keeps going, over and over, like a goddamn loop." 
Narrator "Her voice wavered, and then she broke, a choked sob tearing through her as her breath shuddered." 
Narrator "She rubbed her palms over her face." 
Nina "She... Was the only one who truly believed in me." 
Nina "When everyone else turned their backs, she never did. She was still there, always." 
Nina "We talked every month." 
Narrator "She let out a trembling breath." 
Nina "And now she's gone." 
Nina "And they - my parents - they thought they could just drop that on me like nothing." 
Narrator "I hesitated, but I had to know." 
[Player Name] "What else did they say?" 
Nina "Nothing." 
Narrator "She wiped at her eyes." 
Nina "They told me what happened, and then they just hung up. Just like that." 
Narrator "I had never seen her like this before - completely stripped of the armor she usually wore."  
Narrator "After years of holding it all together, something in her had finally snapped." 
Narrator "Seeing her like this felt like stepping into a moment that I wasn't supposed to witness. It was like I was breaking into a diary." 
Narrator "But I wasn't about to walk away - not now." 
Narrator "Carefully, I reached for the bottle, taking it from her trembling fingers and setting it on the coffee table." 
Narrator "She didn't fight me this time. She was too drained to fight back." 
Narrator "She just sat there, staring down at her lap, silent tears slipping over the edge of her lashes, falling into her lap like drops of ink bleeding into paper." 
[Player Name] “I'll get you some water.” 
Narrator "She sniffled, shaking her head." 
Nina “I don't deserve -”
[Player Name] “Stop that.” 
Nina “I don't care what you think you deserve. I'm not leaving you like this.” 
Narrator "I stood up and disappeared into the kitchenette, returning with a glass of water." 
Nina "She would have hated this."  
Narrator "Her voice was barely above a whisper, but I heard her." 
Nina "She always told me to be strong. To stand tall. To never let them see me break." 
Nina "But I don’t feel strong, [Player Name]. I feel lost. Completely lost."  
Narrator "She stared at it like it was some foreign object before hesitantly taking it from my hands." 
Narrator "She sipped it slowly, grimacing at the taste." 
[Player Name] “You're going to regret this in the morning.” 
Narrator "I told her as she made room for me to sit beside her." 
Narrator "She let out a weak chuckle." 
Nina “Already regret it.”
Narrator "A few minutes passed in silence, the weight of the moment settling between us." 
Narrator "Finally, she spoke again, her voice barely above a whisper." 
Nina “You didn’t have to stay.”
[Player Name] “I know.” 
Narrator "I looked at her." 
[Player Name] “But I wanted to.”
Narrator "She exhaled, long and slow, then leaned her head against my shoulder." 
Nina “You’re annoying.”
Narrator "I smiled slightly." 
[Player Name] “So I have been told.” 
Narrator "She shifted slightly, tilting her face toward me, starting to blush, her eyes heavy-lidded but filled with something else now." 
Nina “You’re too good, you know?” 
Narrator "She murmured, her Italian accent thicker with intoxication." 
Nina “You could stay... Keep me warm tonight.” 
Narrator "She slid closer to me."  
Narrator "I froze." 
[Player Name] “Nina, I don't think…” 
Nina “You don’t have to play hero all the time.”

		Narrator "She tilts her head, eyes fluttering for a moment, as if savoring the anticipation, and I feel my resistance waver." 
		Narrator "Nina leans in, her lips hover just inches from mine, her breath a heady mix of whiskey and something sweet, like cherries." 
		Narrator "She taps her fingers on my arm, two fingers walking up my arm like tiny footsteps." 
		Narrator "When she finally closes the gap, I feel her lips brush mine." 
		Narrator "They're warm, soft, and tinged with the bitter burn of alcohol."

		Narrator "She gestured vaguely at the empty bottles, at herself." 
		Narrator "I sighed, shaking my head."

		Narrator "Her hands clenched into fists against her thighs, then relaxed as if even she wasn’t sure what to do with them."

		Narrator "She then exhaled sharply." 
		Nina "You’re no fun." 
		[Player Name] “Maybe not.” 
		[Player Name] “But I do care about you.” 
		Narrator "She scoffed, rolling her eyes." 
		Nina “Caring. That’s what gets people hurt." 
		Narrator "She said it instinctively, her usual defense mechanism kicking in, but suddenly, something in her expression faltered." 
		Narrator "Her eyes lingered on mine, searching for something, then she sighed." 
		Narrator "She stared at the floor." 
		Nina "I... I don’t know why I do this." 
		Nina "I guess I just like to escape." 
		Nina "Drinking helps me numb it all, even if it's temporary." 
		Narrator "She started twisting the fabric of her shirt as if trying to ground herself." 
		Nina "That’s why I drink. That’s why I do hook ups." 
		Nina "Because they feel good. Even if it's for a little while." 
		Nina "Even if I regret it in the morning." 
		Narrator "Her shoulders slumped, and she let out a hollow laugh, shaking her head as if exhausted by her own confession." 
		Nina "I’m sorry. I know I'm messed up. I just don’t know how else to deal with it." 
		Narrator "I reached over, giving her hand a gentle squeeze, and she tensed up." 
		[Player Name] "You don’t have to handle it alone, Nina." 
		Narrator "She sniffled, nodding slightly, though she still didn’t look at me." 
		Nina "You’re too good to me, you know that?" 
		[Player Name] "Get some rest." 
		Nina "Fine, I’ll go to sleep." 
		Nina "But only if you stay the night."

		Narrator "Then I walked up to the record player, switching off the static hum." 
		[Player Name] "Fine." 
		[Player Name] "Someone has to keep an eye on you." 
		Narrator "As I watched her fall asleep, the dim light of the lamp cast long shadows across the room, flickering over the empty bottles scattered on the table." 
		Narrator "Outside, an owl hooted, its call echoing in the quiet night as I gathered the empty bottles." 
		Narrator "I sank into a nearby chair then leaned back."
