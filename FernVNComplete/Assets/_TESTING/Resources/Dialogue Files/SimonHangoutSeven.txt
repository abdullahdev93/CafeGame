Narrator "The late afternoon sun dipped low over the rolling hills as I drove into Simon's driveway."
Narrator "Simon's house was a grand, ivy-covered estate nestled on the hillside of Baywood Springs."
Narrator "From the front, the home looked as though it belonged on the cover of an architectural magazine."
Narrator "A winding driveway curved gently uphill, flanked by manicured hedges and tall, stately pines."
Narrator "The façade was a mixture of dark wood paneling and sleek stonework, punctuated by enormous windows that reflected the amber sky."
Narrator "A trio of wide stone steps led up to an oversized front door, framed by twin lanterns and hanging ivy."
Narrator "I walked up to the door and rang the doorbell."
Narrator "The door creaked open, revealing Simon with his soft smile but edged with a flicker of nervous energy."
Simon "G-G-Good e-even - uh, hey, $PlayerStats.FirstName."
FirstName "Hi, Simon."
Simon "C-Come on in. M-Make yourself at h-home."
Simon "W-We're nearly f-f-finished m-making d-d-dinner."
Narrator "As I walked in, Simon leaned in and whispered."
Simon "J-Just a h-heads up - s-something you should know - m-my m-mum... she can be, uh... a lot sometimes."

choice "..."
{
	-I've Dealt With Worse
		FirstName "Don't worry, Simon. I've dealt with worse."
		FirstName "Moms who interrogate you before appetizers, family members who stare you down like you're a suspect - it's not my first dinner rodeo."
		Narrator "Simon gave a small chuckle, clearly relieved."
		Simon "S-Sounds like y-you'll do just fine, then."

	-I'm Sure Everything Will Be Fine
		FirstName "It's all right. I'm sure everything will be fine."
		FirstName "I know how to carry myself, and I'm not here to cause any waves."
		Narrator "Simon looked at me with a hint of gratitude but also concern."
		Simon "Th-That's g-good. Just... she's, um, not the easiest person to impress."
		Simon "J-Just be yourself - b-but maybe, uh, like... The best version of that."

	-OK...
		FirstName "OK..."
		Narrator "I blinked, a bit thrown by the sudden warning."
		Narrator "My voice came out more puzzled than tense - less worried, more curious about what exactly he meant."
		Narrator "Simon shot me a sidelong glance and hesitated, likely sensing my confusion."
		Simon "S-Sorry, didn't mean to m-make it sound scary or anything. I-I just thought you should know, that's all."
		Narrator "I nodded slowly, eyebrows slightly furrowed. I wasn't sure what I was walking into, but I was definitely intrigued."
}

Narrator "Simon then spoke under his breath."
Simon "Sh-she also d-doesn't l-like surprises... or, uh... p-people who are t-too... d-different."
Narrator "I then looked forward, stepping back to follow Simon, and that's when I started to truly notice the interior."
Narrator "The foyer was quite breathtaking."
Narrator "A grand, curved staircase swept upward like a ribbon, its banisters gleaming under the soft glow of ceiling lights."
Narrator "At the center, an ornate chandelier dangled from the towering ceiling, casting intricate shadows across the walls and polished floorboards."
Narrator "A pair of vintage chairs flanked a side table topped with a lamp and a small arrangement of plants."
Narrator "As we walked through the hall, I caught Simon glancing at me. Almost like he wanted to say something else but didn't."
Narrator "As we passed the sweeping staircase and ventured deeper into the home, the soft clinking of dishes and a warm aroma hinted at the kitchen ahead."
Narrator "Simon's pace became slower, his steps cautious, as if preparing for something."
Narrator "In the kitchen, bathed in amber light, stood a woman."
Narrator "She wore a dark burgundy dress."

Narrator "Her hair was pinned up with immaculate precision, and not a strand dared fall out of place."
Simon "Mum, thi-thi-this is $PlayerStats.FirstName."
Narrator "His voice was warm but slightly strained."
Narrator "She gave a slow, measured nod, her smile poised and polite."
Victoria as Simon's Mom "Lovely to meet you at last. I do hope dinner's to your liking."
Victoria "Just needs a few more minutes."
Victoria "Simon, why don't you show $PlayerStats.FirstName through to the dining room?"
Narrator "She gestured to where I assume was the direction to the room."
Victoria "I'll be through in a minute."
Narrator "Simon nodded and gestured me to follow him."

Narrator "The dining room also looked like something out of a magazine."
Narrator "A long table stretched beneath a series of ceiling lights that scattered warm light across crystal glasses and delicate China."
Narrator "Everything was meticulously arranged, from the silverware to the folded napkins."
Narrator "Simon and I took our seats across from each other while his mom sat regally at the head of the table."
Narrator "The scent of roasted chicken, sliced carrots, and herbed potatoes wafted through the air."
FirstName "Dinner smells amazing, ma'am."
Victoria as Simon's Mom "How flattering. Let's hope the taste lives up to the aroma, shall we?"
Narrator "She chuckled."
Victoria "And do call me Victoria. No need to stand on ceremony."
Narrator "She leaned back in her chair."
Victoria "So."
Victoria "Simon tells me you're a café owner."
Narrator "I nodded with a confident smile."
FirstName "Yeah, it's something I started a while back. It's small but steadily growing."
Victoria "You must have quite the head for business."
Victoria "Where did you do your business education? Which university?"
FirstName "Oh, I don't have a degree. I dropped out of college. It just wasn't for me."
FirstName "I left to pursue something that I was genuinely passionate about."
Narrator "Victoria's gaze flickered, just for a moment."
Victoria "Drop out of university?"
Victoria "I see."
Victoria "I imagine it's rather demanding, especially without a formal business education."
FirstName "I worked at a café in the past, so I have a lot of hands-on experience."
FirstName "And I took a couple of online courses, which also helped."
Victoria "Online courses? How... Modern."
Narrator "Simon then chimed in."
Simon "Th-They're r-really good with p-people, M-Mum. That's, uh, one of $PlayerStats.FirstName's b-best strengths."
Simon "Th-They even helped with m-my Hamlet project. W-Wouldn't have ace it without them."
Victoria "Ah, yes. You did mention that."
Victoria "I must say, I am curious - where did you find the time to help Simon? I'd have thought the café would keep you rather tied up."
FirstName "I always make time for friends."

if ($PlayerStats.HasStaff == true)
{
	FirstName "Thankfully, I've got a good team at the café - people who run things when I'm not there."
	FirstName "Because of them, I get to step away. Spending time with people I care about, enjoying life - those things matter too."
}

FirstName "If something's important enough, I'll close the café for a day or two. That's the beauty of owning it - I didn't build it just to work nonstop."
FirstName "I genuinely enjoy what I do, but I also believe life's meant to be lived. That means taking time to connect with friends, recharge, and just enjoy the moments that matter."
Victoria "So you simply clock in when it suits-"
Simon "$PlayerStats.FirstName's c-café is, um, it's brilliant. Y-You should st-stop by s-sometime, Mum."
Victoria "Hmm."
Victoria "I'll give it some thought."
Narrator "A moment later, the stove chimed, indicating that the food was finally ready."
Victoria "Ah, sounds like the food's ready."
Victoria "Simon, could you bring the food over?"
Simon "O-Of course, M-Mum."
Narrator "She watched Simon leave the room, then slowly turned her gaze back to me, her polite smile gradually dissolving."
Narrator "Her eyes pinned me in place, sharp and assessing."
Victoria "May I ask - do you truly like for my son? What exactly are your intentions toward him?"
FirstName "I like him. He's a great friend."
Victoria "Simon's always been rather sensitive."
Victoria "He tends to place his trust where it's not always earned."
Victoria "You both appear to have grown close, but he's rarely kept friends who weren't equally driven."
Victoria "Simon needs people who challenge him, who elevate him - not those who might lead him astray."
Victoria "Simon's worked hard to forge his path, and I'd be rather troubled if his associations began to undermine him - both in career and in life."
Victoria "And perhaps, if you truly like Simon, you'll ask yourself whether being so closely involved is truly in his best interests."
Victoria "Not every acquaintance opens doors, you know."
Victoria "Simon's future depends on the company he keeps."
Victoria "And do forgive me if I'm being a touch forward, but I'm not wholly convinced you're quite what he needs."
Narrator "The implication hit like a slap in the face."
Victoria "Food for thought, as they say."

Narrator "As Simon returned with the food, she swiftly reclaimed her polite smile, sliding it back into place like a well-rehearsed mask."
Narrator "As Simon served the food, I took a sip of water, looking at Victoria."
Narrator "The rest of dinner passed with a civil, if somewhat tense, rhythm."
Narrator "Victoria maintained her composed façade, asking me more questions about myself and asking Simon about his classes."
Narrator "Simon tried to keep the conversation light, offering stories from our previous hangouts and from his rehearsals."
Narrator "Eventually, dessert arrived - a beautifully plated custard tart topped with berries."
Narrator "It was delicate and rich; however, it was difficult to fully enjoy with the tension hovering in the room like fog."
Narrator "Still, I made sure to compliment it, earning a small, cool nod from Victoria."
Narrator "After the final forkful was cleared and the table was tidied, Simon offered to walk me out."
Simon "I-I'll w-walk $PlayerStats.FirstName out."
Narrator "I waved at Victoria."
FirstName "Thanks for dinner."
Victoria "Of course, and I do hope this evening's given you something to mull over."
Narrator "She kept her polite smile."
Narrator "The evening air had cooled, and the stars had begun to appear in the sky as we stepped outside."
Narrator "Simon and I walked slowly toward my car, the gravel crunching softly beneath our shoes."
Simon "$PlayerStats.FirstName..."
Narrator "I looked over at him."
Simon "I, um... I heard everything."
Narrator "His face was tense - not angry, just serious."
Simon "Wh-What she said - about you. I h-heard all of it. I was just in the hallway."
Simon "Th-That's wh-why it took me a b-bit to, um, get the food."
Simon "Sh-She's m-made me d-drop a lot of friends b-before, but n-not this time. I d-don't care what she thinks."
Simon "I c-care about y-you."
Simon "A-And our f-friendship... y-you've been there for me in w-ways n-no one else has."
Simon "In w-ways sh-she's n-never really understood."
FirstName "Simon..."

	-I Care About Our Friendship Too
		FirstName "I care about our friendship too."
		FirstName "You're my best friend, Simon."
		FirstName "You've always been kind, honest, and loyal - and when I'm around you, I don't feel like I have to pretend to be anything I'm not. You make me feel seen."
		FirstName "Sure, we've chosen different paths but that doesn't mean we can't still be friends."
		FirstName "I don't care what your mom thinks either."
		FirstName "You get to decide who matters to you, Simon. That choice is yours - not hers."
		Narrator "Simon's lips trembled, but then he smiled - a small, genuine smile that softened his features."
		Simon "R-right."
		Simon "I'll see you next time."
		FirstName "Hell yeah!"

	-I Don't Think We Should Be Friends Anymore
		FirstName "Simon, I... I don't think we should be friends anymore."
		Narrator "His face crumpled. Whatever breath he had drawn froze in his chest."
		FirstName "It's not because I don't care. I do. You're one of the most genuine people I've ever met."
		FirstName "But tonight made me realize how different our worlds are."
		FirstName "Your mom... she's always going to see me as a threat."
		FirstName "And I can't keep putting you in a position where you constantly have to defend me."
		Simon "Oh..."
		Narrator "His voice was barely a whisper. The moonlight glinted off his glassy eyes, pooling quietly in the corners."
		FirstName "You deserve peace. You deserve to pursue your dreams without worrying about how others might judge you based on your company."
		Narrator "Simon looked down, his hands clenching slightly at his sides."
		Simon "I understand."
		Narrator "He took a slow breath, then nodded."
		Narrator "As he turned to walk away, I stood there for a second too long, heart heavy, wishing I had the words to soften what I'd said."
		FirstName "Simon..."
		Narrator "He paused, but didn't look back."
		FirstName "I hope you know... I'll always root for you. Even from a distance."
		Narrator "Simon stood still for a heartbeat, then nodded once more, this time tighter, and continued walking."
		Narrator "The door closed behind him, quiet but final."
		Narrator "I sighed, then slowly made my way to the car."
		Narrator "As I sat behind the wheel, I stared out at the empty street, wondering if I'd made the right decision - or simply the one that hurt the least."

Narrator "Simon took a step back, then turned as if to walk away."
Narrator "But after only a few paces, he suddenly stopped."
Narrator "He stood there, frozen, shoulders rising with a held breath."
FirstName "Simon?"
Narrator "Then without another word, he turned and walked back - fast, like a thought had just broken free."
Narrator "He reached me, eyes flicking between mine - nervous, searching for something."
Narrator "Then, suddenly, like something snapped loose inside him, Simon lunged forward."
Narrator "He cupped both sides of my neck and kissed me - passionately."
Narrator "The kiss was tentative, delicate - like he was afraid I might disappear."
Narrator "But it deepened, slowly, like something long buried had finally surfaced."
Narrator "When he pulled back, he lingered for a second, his breath mixing with mine."
FirstName "Simon..."
Narrator "My heart was still catching up to what had just happened. My breath shallow."
Narrator "I blinked, stunned, the warmth of his hands still lingering at my neck."
FirstName "Wait... Simon - does your mom know?"
Narrator "He shook his head, slowly."
Simon "N-No... I-I haven't told her. I d-don't even know if she'd want to know."
Narrator "There was a vulnerability in his voice that cut deeper than any of his stutters ever could."
Simon "I w-was scared. Still am, honestly."
Simon "B-But I couldn't leave tonight without letting you know how I f-feel."
FirstName "OK."
FirstName "I should go."
FirstName "I'll see you later."
Narrator "Simon smiled - the same soft smile he gave when meeting him at the door."
Narrator "Only this time, there was no nervous energy."
Narrator "I then drove off into the night."
Narrator "My fingers curled around the steering wheel and my pulse thundered in my ears."
FirstName "Did that really just happen?"
