Narrator "As the sun dipped below the horizon, casting golden rays across familiar streets, I sat quietly in the backseat of my parents' car, watching the world blur by."
Narrator "For as long as I can remember, my parents had a vision for my life." 
Narrator "College, career, comfort."
Narrator "And for a while, I believed in that vision too." 
Narrator "After all, I was their only child - their pride and joy. I didn't want to disappoint them."
Narrator "My dad, an architect. My mom, a lawyer. Two people who built their lives from scratch and believed that structure, success, and sacrifice were the only paths to happiness."
Narrator "They wern't cruel. They were passionate, opinionated, and yes, overbearing - but they loved me in their own way."
Narrator "Still, love can feel suffocating when it comes with conditions. Many conditions." 

Narrator "After high school, I went straight to college, and they were overjoyed."
Narrator "Each semester, I carried the weight of their expectations on my shoulders." 
Narrator "I passed my classes, got decent grades. Never partied. Never explored."
Narrator "I was the child they wanted me to be." 
Narrator "But with every passing year, I felt myself more and more empty." 

Narrator "I started working part-time at a local café during my second year - mostly to get away from campus, to feel like I had some control."
Narrator "At first, it was just a job." 
Narrator "But over time, something changed." 
Narrator "I loved it. The smell of coffee. The quiet hum of conversation. The sense of community in something so small."
Narrator "I found joy in memorizing regulars' orders, crafting a perfect cup of coffee, seeing people relax into the atmosphere I helped create."

Narrator "It was there, in that little café off campus, that I started to resent my parents." 
Narrator "Not because they were bad parents, but because they never asked me what I wanted."
Narrator "Their love always came with a blueprint." 
Narrator "And I was done following it." 

Narrator "The lectures and routines started to feel meaningless. I'd stare out of classroom windows and imagine a different life."
Narrator "One where I didn't have to pretend. One where I could wake up excited about something - not dreading another day of someone else's plan."

Narrator "And so, I dropped out when the current semester ended. Not in rebellion. Not in failure." 
Narrator "But in quiet, painful clarity." 

Narrator "I wanted something else. Something simple. Something mine."
Narrator "I wanted to open a café."
Narrator "Fortunately, I'd been saving up since high school - working part-time jobs, budgeting every dollar." 
Narrator "I spent weekends sketching menu ideas and researching machines I couldn't afford."
Narrator "It sounded ridiculous to a lot of people, but to me, it was a future. A real one."

Narrator "Now, after all this time, I was back in the car with my parents, taking me home after finishing another semester of college." 
Narrator "I had to tell them the truth." 
Narrator "Will they accept that?" 
Narrator "I watched the trees blur past. The streets I used to walk. The neighbors' houses still decorated from last season."
Narrator "Everything was so familiar and yet felt so foreign."
Narrator "Before I knew it, we were home." 
Narrator "We got out of the car, walked past the two-door garage, then walked on the concrete path to the front door." 
Narrator "The sight of the house filled me with a mixed sense of comfort and imprisonment." 
Narrator "I'm grateful that my parents gave me so much, but I'm tired of doing things their way."

Narrator "It's time for me to start a new chapter of my life. One where I can finally be myself and do what I want to do."

Narrator "Today is the day. I have to tell them the truth." 
Narrator "I have to tell my parents how I feel." 
Narrator "No more pretending. No more polite nods and vague responses about 'future plans.'" 
Narrator "I can't hide my feelings forever." 
Narrator "They're going to find out eventually." 
Narrator "I stood in front of the mirror, running through every scenario. Would they yell? Would they laugh? Would they be disappointed?"
Narrator "They're going to want to know why I won't be attending college in the Summer."  
Narrator "I took a deep breath, collected my thoughts, and prepared for the worse."

Narrator "I called them into the living room, gesturing them to sit on the sofa across from me." 
Narrator "The air in the living room felt heavy with tension, my hands clasped tightly on my lap." 
Narrator "I took a breath." 
Narrator "Mom, Dad. I haven't been honest with you." 
Narrator "My parents exchanged a worried glance, their expressions reflecting a mix of curiosity and concern." 
Narrator "I know that you just want what's best for me, even going as far as to strongly suggest following in your footsteps." 
Narrator "Either to pursue a career in architecture just like you, Dad." 
Narrator "Or go into law, just like you both did, Mom." 
Narrator "I've spent a lot of time thinking about this. The truth is-" 
Narrator "This is it. I have to tell them. I have to stand up to them." 
Narrator "The truth is... I went to college for you. Not for me."
Narrator "I tried. I really tried." 
Narrator "But I was never happy."
Narrator "So... I dropped out." 
Narrator "They both froze."
Dad "You what?"
Mom "You dropped out of college? Without telling us?"
Narrator "I want to do my own thing. I want a simple and fun life." 
Narrator "I want to open a café."
Narrator "I could see the disbelief flicker across their faces, quickly replaced by a mixture of shock and disappointment, then anger." 
Dad "Preposterous! We've sacrificed so much to give you every opportunity to succeed." 
Dad "Are you saying that's not good enough for you!?" 
Mom "Are you kidding me? We've worked hard to give you the opportunities we never had." 
Mom "We paved a perfect road for you to follow, a successful road. Do you think we did all of this just so you could end up making coffee?" 
Narrator "No, Dad, that's not what I'm saying." 
Narrator "I appreciate everything you've both done for me, I have, but I need to follow my own path, not the one expected of me." 
Narrator "And I'm very serious about this, I want to have my own café."
Narrator "And college is not going to help me accomplish that." 
Dad "Self-employment is not the best route. You should want a job with benefits." 
Narrator "There are benefits to being self-employment – flexibility, unlimited earnings, and independence."

Mom "There's also no insurance and no job security. If you ask me, there are no benefits at all!"

Mom "Oregon? Are you serious? After everything we've done to put you on the right track, you're just going to throw it all away for some... Small-town coffee shop?"
Narrator "It's not just a coffee shop. I want to create a place where people come together, where I can craft something that's my own. A place that feels like home to everyone who walks in."
Mom "That sounds nice, but 'feeling like home' isn't going to pay the bills." 
Mom "You could have a real career, something secure, like engineering or business." 
Mom "You can't throw away real opportunities for some dream." 

Dad "Running a café in some small town? Do you really think that's a path to success?" 
Dad "You could be studying, preparing for a real career, but you want to serve coffee for strangers in the middle of nowhere?"
Mom "So, what? You'll be the friendly local barista? That's not a career."

Dad "Have you even thought this through? Owning a café isn't just pouring coffee for people."
Narrator "I know! I have researched everything. I'll handle managing the shop, talking to customers, creating a menu people will love." 
Narrator "I worked at a café."
Narrator "I'll build something special, a place where people can find comfort, a second home." 
Dad "You can't just rely on 'comfort' and 'homey vibes.'" 
Dad "You need money, you need experience, and, frankly, you need a better plan." 
Dad "What happens when no one wants to hang out in your 'homey little café'?" 
Dad "And since when did you work at a café?"

Mom "Have you thought about the long-term? How will you handle managing inventory, dealing with customers, paying bills, and staying open in a place like Baywood Springs?"
Narrator "Yes, I have thought it all through. Mostly. I have experience." 
Narrator "And I'll be learning new things every day - more about business, customer service, creating drinks, and building relationships." 
Narrator "I'm not afraid of hard work, and this is how I want to grow."
Mom "Learning what? How to make people like you? You'll burn yourself out in no time if you think running a small business is as easy as chatting with customers."

Mom "Or are you just trying to avoid responsibility? This fantasy of yours might look exciting now, but reality doesn't revolve around coffee and pastries."
