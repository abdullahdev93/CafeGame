		Narrator "The cool evening air filled my lungs as I jogged along the winding path through the town's local park, my breath steady and controlled."
		Narrator "The setting sun painted the sky in streaks of orange and pink, casting a soft glow over the gently swaying trees."
		Narrator "Crickets had begun their nightly chorus, their chirps blending with the rhythmic sound of my footsteps against the pavement."
		Narrator "A light breeze drifted through the park, carrying the faint scent of blooming flowers and the lingering warmth of the sunbaked earth."
		Narrator "By the time I slowed to a walk near the far end of the park, a satisfying ache settled in my legs."
		Narrator "I wiped the sweat from my forehead as my heartbeat gradually steadied, the first stars beginning to flicker in the sky."
		Narrator "Despite the fatigue and aches, I felt stronger, faster."
		Narrator "Like my Endurance had just improved."
