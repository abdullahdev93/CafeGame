Narrator "We left the bar and stepped out into the cool night, the town quieter now, only the occasional car passing by." 
Narrator "Nina led the way as we walked in near silence." 
Narrator "Nina's apartment wasn't far, just a few blocks away, nestled between an old bookstore and a closed arcade." 
Narrator "The building looked a little run-down, but it had a certain charm."  
Nina "Here it is." 
Narrator "She stopped in front of a small staircase, leading to the door of her building." 
Narrator "Mind if you walk me in?"

Narrator "Once we got to her apartment door, she pulled out her keys from her purse." 
Narrator "She fumbled with her keys for a moment before managing to unlock her apartment door." 
Nina "You wanna come in? It's not much, but... I got coffee, if you're interested."

		Narrator "I walked into her studio apartment." 
		Narrator "It was small, cluttered with canvases stacked against the walls like dominos, paintbrushes scattered across an area of the floor, and a half-finished painting mounted on an easel." 
		Narrator "The faint smell of paint and turpentine filled the air. A single lamp by the window casted a warm glow across the space that was supposed to be the living room." 
		Narrator "A russina blue cat walked up to Nina as Nina kneeled, almost like she anticipated it." 
		Nina "Luna!"  
		Narrator "She holds the cat, carassing it for a moment before setting down it." 
		Narrator "Luna walked away afterward." 
		Nina "Sorry for the mess. I wasn't expecting company today." 
		Narrator "Nina shrugged."  
		Nina "It's a bit of a disaster, but I have a system." 
		Narrator "It's definitely got character." 
		Narrator "I continued looking around." 
		Narrator "Definitely feels like an artist lives here." 
		Narrator "She smiled sheepishly and moved toward the small kitchenette." 
		Nina "I wasn't kidding about the coffee, you know. You want some?" 
		Narrator "Maybe later." 
		Narrator "I stepped closer to the mounted painting, a chaotic mix of colors swirling on the canvas."  
		Narrator "This is really cool. You're really talented." 
		Narrator "Nina paused after sipping her cup of premade and microwaved coffee, looking at me from across the room." 
		Nina "Thanks. That means a lot to hear." 
		Narrator "We exchanged a quiet look, and there was a shift in the air - Nina set the cup of coffee down and moved closer to me, her gaze flicking between me and the floor." 
		Nina "I'm sure you're just saying that to be nice." 
		Narrator "I'm not." 
		Nina "You could... Stay, if you want."  
		Nina "Like you said, it's getting late." 
		Narrator "Nina's hand rested on my arm, her fingers light, almost hesitant."

	-It's Late 
		Narrator "It's getting late." 
		Narrator "I should get going." 
		Nina "Oh, uh, right. That... Cafe isn't going to manage itself." 
		Narrator "Y-Yeah." 
		Narrator "It was nice meeting you, Nina." 
		Nina "Likewise." 
		Nina "Maybe I should exchange contacts?" You got Picstagram?" 
		Narrator "I do." 
		Narrator "Nina and I exchanged usernames before I left back to the apartment." 
		Narrator "As I walked home, I couldn't help think about my time with Nina." 
		Narrator "There was something about her raw honesty. I feel like she's someone on the edge of something."  
		Narrator "She's not just another artist. She's has a talent - a talent to turn pain into beauty, even if she hasn't fully realized yet." 
		Narrator "Whatever it was, she was a fighter, even if she didn't know it yet."
