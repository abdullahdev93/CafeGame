Narrator "... The Old Fashioned?"
Bartender "Comin' right up."
Mei "I'll take a glass of Red Wine."
Bartender "Got it."
Narrator "As the bartender prepared our drinks, I leaned against the counter, glancing at Mei." 
Narrator "Not feeling adventurous tonight?"
Narrator "She smirked and looked at me while resting her elbow on the counter." 
Mei "I know what I like, and it's best to play it safe on some days." 
Mei "Don't want to waste money on something I might not even enjoy when I already have a guaranteed good choice."
Narrator "Fair enough."
Narrator "The bartender slid our drinks in front of us." 
Narrator "I lifted my Old Fashioned, taking a slow sip, the warmth of the whiskey settling deep in my chest." 
Narrator "Mei, meanwhile, swirled her glass of wine, inhaling the aroma before taking a sip with a content sigh."
Mei "Now this is a drink."
Narrator "I chuckled, setting my glass down." 
Narrator "You really don't like whiskey, huh?"
Mei "I don't hate it, but if I have a choice between feeling like a refined poet or a detective in a noir film, I'm picking the poet every time."
Narrator "The bar hummed with low chatter and soft music." 
Narrator "We talked, our conversation flowing easily."
Narrator "Time slipped away between sips, stories, and quiet laughter." 
Narrator "We lost track of time, caught up in conversation until the bar's lively buzz began to mellow." 
Narrator "Eventually, with a shared glance and final sips, we knew it was time to call it a night.
