Narrator "... A glass of Red Wine."
Bartender "Comin' right up."
Mei "Make that two."
Bartender "You got it."
Narrator "As the bartender left to prepare our drinks, I leaned against the counter." 
Narrator "I turned to look at Mei and noticed the surprised yet pleased look on Mei's face." 
Narraor "Mei nodded." 
Mei "You have taste." 
Narrator "I smirked." 
Narrator "What, you think I only drink cheap beer?" 
Narrator "What can I say? Red Wine's got something special to it." 
Mei "Oh? Do tell." 
Narrator "It's... Layered. There's a richness to it, but it's not just about taste - it's about the feeling."
Narrator "She smiled as she picked up her own glass." 
Mei "Go on."
Narrator "It's got this depth - sometimes bold, sometimes subtle." 
Narrator "It lingers, it builds. It's not the kind of drink you just throw back." 
Narrator "You take your time with it, appreciate it."
Narrator "She let out a small, delighted laugh." 
Mei "Holy hell. Finally. Someone who gets it."
Narrator "I chuckled, raising my glass slightly." 
Narrator "What do you mean?" 
Mei "A lot of people just order it to feel fancy and then complain if it's too dry."
Narrator "I smirked." 
Narrator "Guess I passed the Mei Wu wine appreciation test?"
Narrator "She clinked her glass lightly against mine." 
Mei "Barely, but I'll allow it."
Narrator "She laughed." 
Narrator "The bartender slid our glasses in front of us, the deep crimson liquid swirling as I picked mine up."
Narrator "We both took a sip at the same time." 
Narrator "We both made a refreshing sigh." 
Narrator "I swirled my glass, watching the way the light caught the deep color." 
Narrator "The bar hummed with low chatter and country music as we talked, our conversation flowing effortlessly between sips, sarcasm, and laughter." 
Narrator "Eventually, as the bar's lively buzz began to mellow, we exchanged a glance over our near-empty glasses." 
Narrator "And with a final sip, we knew it was time to call it a night."
