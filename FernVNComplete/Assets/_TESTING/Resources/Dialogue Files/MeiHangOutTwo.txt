Narrator "As I made my way to the library, I contemplated on which genres would be best to read." 
Narrator "If Mei is working there today, she could give me great recommendations." 
Narrator "The moment I stepped inside, the scent of old pages and wood polish greeted me." 
Narrator "The air felt calm, almost sacred - the kind of quiet that makes you lower your voice without even thinking about it."
Narrator "One of the librarians looked up from the front desk and offered me a gentle smile before leaning forward slightly." 
Narrator "She whispered to me."

Librarian "Ah, you must be $PlayerStats.FirstName - the owner of Bean Bliss." 
Librarian "Mei talks about your café." 
Librarian "She says it's her favorite place to unwind after work." 
Narrator "I blushed, feeling a little honored." 
Narrator "The librarian smiled and reached for her small radio." 
Narrator "After a soft buzz of static, she spoke quietly into it, asking where Mei was." 

Librarian "She's in the Horror section right now, organizing the shelves." 
Librarian "It's upstairs, between Fantasy and Romance." 
FirstName "Thank you." 
Narrator "As I climbed the stairs to the Horror section, the faint creak of wood echoed under my steps along with the quiet hum of the air conditioner and the subtle rustle of turning pages." 
Narrator "I then saw her between towering shelves, diligently organizing books from a cart." 
Narrator "She turned, brushing a strand of hair from her face, and when she saw me, her face lit up with a smile as I approached."
