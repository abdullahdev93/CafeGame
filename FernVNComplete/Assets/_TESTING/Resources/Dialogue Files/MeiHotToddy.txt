Narrator "... A Hot Toddy."
Bartender "You got it. One comfort drink coming up."
Mei "And I'll take a glass of Red Wine."
Bartender "Wine for you, toddy for you - be right back."

Narrator "I leaned on the counter, feeling the bar's warmth settle in as the low hum of conversation filled the room."
Narrator "I glanced over at Mei, a grin tugging at my lips."
Narrator "Red Wine again? You're not tempted by the seasonal specials?"
Mei "She gave me a look, amused."  
Mei "I don't need a themed drink to feel festive." 
Mei "Red wine does the job - no surprises, no regrets."
Narrator "Fair enough. I guess I'm the one chasing cozy tonight."

Narrator "The bartender returned and placed our drinks in front of us."
Narrator "The Hot Toddy's warmth drifted up in soft steam - honey, lemon, spice - it smelled like a quiet evening in."
Narrator "I cupped it in both hands, letting the heat consume my fingers before taking a sip." 
Narrator "A contently sighed as the warmth of the drink settled in my chest." 

Mei "A Hot Toddy, huh? You planning to read poetry next or just win 'coziest guy in the room'?"
Narrator "I chuckled, letting the steam warm my face."
Narrator "What can I say? Some nights call for a little comfort in a cup."
Mei "She took a sip of her wine, still watching me."
Mei "It's kind of charming, actually." 
Mei "Most people try to look cool at bars." 
Mei "You look like you're just... Being you."
Narrator "I met her gaze, the warmth of the drink settling in my chest."
Narrator "Maybe that's what makes it taste even better." 

Narrator "The bar lights cast a soft amber glow as we kept talking."
Narrator "We covered everything from favorite songs to oddly specific food cravings." 

Narrator "Eventually, Mei set her empty glass down and glanced toward the door."
Mei "All right, walk me home, [Player Name]?"
Narrator "I took my last sip of the Hot Toddy then set the glass down."  
Narrator "Let's go."
