Narrator "I kept stirring the risotto, adding the stock at just the right pace, and the rice absorbed it beautifull." 
Narrator "When Nina returned, she peered into the pot and smiled."
Nina "Perfect! You have got the touch, [Player Name]. This is exactly how it should look." 
Narrator "Her approval felt like a small victory, and together we plated the risotto."
Narrator "Nina then showed me how to roll out fresh pasta dough, her hands deftly shaping it into thin sheets before we ran it through her small pasta machine." 
Narrator "She explained how her grandmother in Italy used to make pasta by hand, painting a vivid picture of flour-dusted countertops and rhythmic rolling pin movements."
Nina "She taught me everything." 
Nina "Cooking was her art. I guess that's why I like it so much." 
Narrator "We layered the sheets into a simple fettuccine dish with a store-bought tomato sauce." 
Nina "The key is to mostly use fresh ingredients." 
Narrator "She said as she tossed in chopped basil, its fragrance filling the air." 
Narrator "You can use a few store-bought ingredients to make things easier, though." 
Narrator "Finally, for dessert, Nina introduced me to affogato - a scoop of creamy vanilla gelato drowned in a shot of freshly brewed espresso."
[Player Name] "Is that why you wanted me to bring some of my coffee?"
Narrator "I grinned."
Nina "Yes." 
Nina "This is a simple but elegant dessert in my home country."
Narrator "By the time we finished cooking, the apartment was filled with the warmth of Italian food and the glow of her small kitchen lights." 
Narrator "She brought out a foldable table and set it up in the living room while I carried the dishes over." 
Narrator "We settled onto the couch, balancing plates and bowls."
Nina "You're pretty good at balancing those dishes."

		Narrator "I shrugged." 
		[Player Name] "I worked in a restaurant before opening my café." 
		[Player Name] "Back then, it felt like chaos - endless orders, demanding customers, and juggling way too many things at once." 
		[Player Name] "But it also gave me the inspiration to do something more personal." 
		[Player Name] "Managing a café feels easier, and I like that it's more about connecting with people than just rushing to keep up."

Narrator "I finally looked down at my plate and took a bite." 
Narrator "As I tasted the first bite, my eyes widened slightly, and I sat back in my chair, savoring the flavor." 
Narrator "The Parmesan added a nutty depth, while the fresh parsley brought a hint of brightness to the dish." 
Narrator "Each bite melted in my mouth, the flavors mingling in a way that felt both comforting and indulgent."
[Player Name] "This is... Amazing." 
Nina "I'm glad you're enjoying it." 
Narrator "While eating, Nina turned on the TV, queuing an animated movie." 
Nina "This is one of my favorite childhood movies." 
Narrator "The characters moved through lush, hand-painted landscapes, their dialogue mixing humor with profound moments of introspection."
Nina "Look at the detail in that scene." 
Narrator "She pointed to a shot of a character running through a field of sunflowers swaying in the wind." 
Nina "It's beautiful."
Narrator "As the movie progressed, we fell into silence, engrossed in the movie."  
Narrator "At some point, Nina shifted closer, resting her head on my shoulder."
