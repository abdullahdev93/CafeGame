Narrator "A Margarita."
Bartender "Comin' right up." 
Battender "Salted rim?"
Narrator "Of course."
Mei "I'll take a glass of Red Wine."
Bartender "Got it."
Narrator "As the bartender prepared our drinks, I leaned against the counter, glancing at Mei, an amused smirk tugging at my lips." 
Narrator "Playing it safe tonight?"
Mei "She rolled her eyes, resting her elbow on the counter." 
Mei "It's not that I don't want to have fun. It's just that one bad tequila night is all it takes to put someone off for life."
Narrator "Sounds like you're talking with experience."
Mei "She shook her head with a knowing smirk." 
Mei "Let's just say... I don't want to make the same mistakes twice." 
Narrator "Fair enough." 
Narrator "The bartender eventually slid our drinks in front of us." 
Narrator "I took a sip, the salted rim brushing my lips as the tangy mix of lime and tequila hit my tongue." 
Mei "She swirled her wine, inhaling the aroma before taking a slow, contented sip." 
Mei "Now this is a drink."
Narrator "I chuckled, setting my glass down." 
Narrator "You really don't like tequila, huh?"
Mei "Let's just say, it doesn't like me back." 
Mei "It got me to makeout with one of my exes." 
Narrator "She stood quiet for a moment before taking another sip." 
Narrator "The chatter around us blurred into the background as we began to settle into conversation again."
Narrator "Time slipped away between sips, stories, and quiet laughter." 
Narrator "We lost track of time, caught up in conversation until the bar's lively buzz began to mellow." 
Narrator "Eventually, with a shared glance and final sips, we knew it was time to call it a night.
