Narrator "Simon invited me out to dinner at a place he referred to as a hidden gem."
Narrator "Curious, I followed the pin he sent me and soon found myself pulling into a strip mall." 
Narrator "The lot smelled faintly of fried food, oak trees, and asphalt cooling in the evening air."
Narrator "Stepping out of my car, I held up my phone to orient myself toward the pin." 
Narrator "When I looked up from my phone, I spotted a restaurant tucked quietly between a bright boba shop and a weathered convenience store."
Narrator "The restaurant looked like one of those places you only find if you're not looking for it, and knowing Simon, that was probably exactly how he discovered it." 

Narrator "Its modest exterior had no flashing neon sign or polished host stand, just a wooden sign overhead painted with the name of the restaurant, The Lantern." 
Narrator "The carved letters caught the glow of a nearby streetlight, casting long shadows that stretched across the bright windows." 
Narrator "Inside, the place felt like magic." 
Narrator "Candles glowed in tiny glass jars on each table, flickering gently against walls lined with old black‑and‑white photos, and the scent of garlic, butter, and fresh herbs drifting from the kitchen." 
Narrator "Simon waved at me, letting me know where he was sitting." 
Narrator "I approached his table and sat across from him, his fingers nervously picking at the folded cloth napkin, the fabric soft and worn from years of use." 
Narrator "He twisted and folded it so tightly that I thought it might tear." 
Narrator "The booths were high‑backed and private, muffling the clink of silverware and low murmur of other diners." 
Narrator "A waiter arrived just moments after I slid into the booth, balancing a small notepad in his hand."
Waiter "Would you like to order drinks?"
Simon "I-I'll t-t-take a w-water."
FirstName "Same."
Narrator "The waiter scribbled down the order with a quick nod before disappearing toward the kitchen." 
Narrator "When he left, Simon's fingers went right back to nervously folding and unfolding the napkin."
