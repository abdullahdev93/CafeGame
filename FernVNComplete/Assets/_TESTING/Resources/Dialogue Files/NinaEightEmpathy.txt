	-Take It Off Her Hands
		Narrator "Then let me take it off your hands." 
		Narrator "Just for a while." 
		Narrator "You don't have to look at it or decide anything right now." 
		Narrator "I'll keep it safe until you’re ready." 
		Narrator "It deserves better than being hidden under a blanket."
		Narrator "Nina looked at me, her expression unreadable at first, almost like she was conflicted on what to do."  
		Nina "You'd... Really do that? Take it?"
		Narrator "Of course. This painting... It's not just paint on canvas. It's a reflection of you. The real you."
		Narrator "A part of you that you should accept, not hide away." 
		Narrator "No part of you should be buried."
		Nina "Even the ugly ones?"
		Narrator "Especially the ugly ones. They're the parts that make us who we are, who we become." 
		Narrator "I'll take it." 
		Narrator "Just to give you a little break from it." 
		Narrator "And when you're ready, I'll bring it back." 
		Narrator "She was quiet, but she picked up the canvas, moving it slowly to me like it might fall apart." 
		Narrator "Her hands brushed against mine as she turned it toward me." 
		Nina "All right... Yeah. Maybe that would be best." 
		Narrator "Don't worry, it's not going in a storage closet or under my bed. I'll hang it on my wall, somewhere I can still make it feel seen." 
		Narrator "You deserve that much." 
		Narrator "Nina looked around." 
		Nina "We should really get back to cleaning." 
		Narrator "Yeah." 
		Narrator "I helped her detangle fairy lights from a mannequin arm while she folded up an old drop cloth, humming something quiet under her breath."
		Narrator "We sorted sketchbooks into stacks." 
		Narrator "She dusted off her shelves while I wiped down her desk, carefully avoiding a cracked mug that held a dozen stiff paintbrushes like war medals."
		Narrator "We took turns folding paint-stained rags." 
		Narrator "By the time we finished, it was spacious and no longer looked like a cluttered museum." 
		Narrator "Nina smiled." 
		Nina "Thanks for helping me today." 
		Narrator "She walked me to the door, carrying the painting on her left side." 
		Nina "I should get back to work." 
		Nina "I got a few commissions to finish." 
		Narrator "She handed me the portrait."  
		Narrator "She started playing with of the hem of her shirt." 
		Nina "Really.... Thank you. For helping me clean, and for... Everything." 
		Narrator "I gave her a small smile."
		Narrator "I'll check in on you soon." 
		Narrator "I'll bring it back when you're ready." 
		Narrator "She smiled." 
		Narrator "She gave me a soft wave as I stepped out, the door closing gently behind me."  

	-Hang It
		Narrator "You should hang it. For yourself."
		Narrator "Nina blinked, a little thrown by the suggestion." 
		Nina "What do you mean?"
		Narrator "I mean stop hiding it. Put it on the wall. Let it exist. Let her exist."
		Nina "Even if I hate it? Even if it hurts to me to see it?"
		Narrator "Yeah." 
		Narrator "Because that painting - it's not just brushstrokes and colors. It's you." 
		Narrator "And to keep it buried under a blanket, is like pretending that version of you never existed."
		Narrator "She was hurting, but she was brave. She created something vulnerable. Something real." 
		Narrator "And that deserves to be remembered - not erased."
		Narrator "Nina looked at the painting like it might bite her." 
		Narrator "Hanging it would be accepting and honoring the girl who had the guts to pour her pain and passion into something, even when she was scared." 
		Narrator "To hide it would be to disrespect her. To forget her."
		Narrator "Nina was quiet, the weight of those words settling over her like dust in warm light."
		Nina "What if it's easier to forget? What if remembering her just hurts me?"
		Narrator "It hurts you because you care." 
		Narrator "I looked at the portrait, then back at Nina." 
		Narrator "Her eyes avoided mine and her lips pressed together like she was holding something back." 
		Narrator "My gaze dropped for a moment, thinking in silence, and that's when it all clicked for me." 
		Narrator "I get it now, it's not that you want to forget her. It's that you haven't forgiven yourself." 
		Narrator "Nina stood quiet." 
		Narrator "You're not angry at her for dreaming. You're angry at yourself for not living up to those dreams."
		Narrator "She wasn't naïve. She was hopeful. Brave." 
		Narrator "She still fought for something that mattered to her." 
		Narrator "A silent tear slipped down Nina's cheek, and she made no attempt to wipe it away." 
		Narrator "She looked down, brushing the bottom edge of the frame with her fingertips like she was afraid it might disappear if she let go." 
		Narrator "A long silence passed." 
		Narrator "Then she took a slow breath and looked back at me." 
		Nina "OK." 
		Narrator "Nina looked around." 
		Nina "We should really get back to cleaning." 
		Narrator "Yeah." 
		Narrator "I helped her detangle fairy lights from a mannequin arm while she folded up an old drop cloth, humming something quiet under her breath."
		Narrator "We sorted sketchbooks into stacks." 
		Narrator "She dusted off her shelves while I wiped down her desk, carefully avoiding a cracked mug that held a dozen stiff paintbrushes like war medals."
		Narrator "We took turns folding paint-stained rags."  
		Narrator "By the time we finished, it was spacious and no longer looked like a cluttered museum." 
		Narrator "Nice and clean." 
		Nina "We're just missing one more thing." 
		Narrator "She looked at the painting." 
		Narrator "Nina and I hanged it together on the wall, in between the living room and the kitchenette." 
		Narrator "Nina looked at it with a mixed expression." 
		Nina "It's... Going to take some getting used to." 
		Narrator "She then looked at me." 
		Nina "Thanks for helping me today." 
		Narrator "She walked me to the door." 
		Nina "I wish you can stay but I have to get back to work." 
		Nina "I got a few commissions to finish." 
		Narrator "She started playing with of the hem of her shirt." 
		Nina "Really.... Thank you. For helping me clean, and for... Everything." 
		Narrator "I gave her a small smile."
		Narrator "I'll check in on you soon." 
		Narrator "Hopefully, that painting is still there when I visit again." 
		Nina "I'll do my best to keep it up." 
		Narrator "She gave me a soft wave as I stepped out, the door closing gently behind me."  

	-Burn It 
		Narrator "Then let's burn it. Not just for closure, but to give you a clean slate." 
		Nina "What do you mean?" 
		Narrator "Let's make a bonfire, toss this painting along with whatever else causes you pain, and let the flames take them." 
		Narrator "Nina's eyes widened, searching my face for any hint of sarcasm." 
		Nina "You're serious?" 
		Narrator "Only if you are." 
		Narrator "If this painting really hurts to keep around then maybe it's time to let it go." 
		Narrator "Not as a failure, but as a way of closing a chapter to outgrown." 
		Narrator "Let go of the past, so you can focus on who you want to become." 
		Narrator "Nina stared at the canvas for a long time, her fingers twitching slightly." 
		Nina "I always wondered what it would feel like... To just destroy it." 
		Nina "Not out of anger but to free myself." 
		Nina "This thing - it's haunted me. It's been the ghost of everything I thought I was supposed to be." 
		Narrator "Then let's lay that ghost to rest." 
		Narrator "And start over. Recreate yourself into the person you want to be now." 
		Narrator "Nina was quiet for a long moment." 
		Narrator "Then she laughed. It was soft but real." 
		Nina "All right, let's do it." 
		Narrator "Nina nodded, smiling now, and her spine straightened just a little- almost like she felt relief." 
		Nina "Should I wear black for the occasion?" 
		Narrator "Only if it's fireproof." 
		Nina "Damn. Wasted all of my fireproof gear on that time I tried to make flambé cherries and almost set my bangs on fire." 
		Narrator "We laughed, lightening the mood." 
		Narrator "Nina looked around." 
		Nina "We should really get back to cleaning." 
		Narrator "Yeah." 
		Narrator "I helped her detangle fairy lights from a mannequin arm while she folded up an old drop cloth, humming something quiet under her breath." 
		Narrator "We sorted sketchbooks into stacks." 
		Narrator "She dusted off her shelves while I wiped down her desk, carefully avoiding a cracked mug that held a dozen stiff paintbrushes like war medals." 
		Narrator "We took turns folding paint-stained rags." 
		Narrator "By the time we finished, it was spacious and no longer looked like a cluttered museum." 
		Narrator "First step to change." 
		Nina "Now time for the next step." 
		Narrator "She looked at the painting." 
		Narrator "Next time." 
		Narrator "Nina nodded." 
		Nina "Thanks for helping me today." 
		Narrator "She walked me to the door." 
		Nina "I wish you can stay but I have to get back to work." 
		Nina "I got a few commissions to finish." 
		Narrator "She started playing with of the hem of her shirt." 
		Nina "Really.... Thank you. For helping me clean, and for... Everything." 
		Narrator "I gave her a small smile." 
		Narrator "I'll check in on you soon." 
		Narrator "We can discuss where to burn the painting then." 
		Nina "Nina smiled." 
		Narrator "She gave me a soft wave as I stepped out, the door closing gently behind me."
