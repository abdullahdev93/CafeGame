Narrator "... A Whiskey Sour."  
Bartender "Nice choice. Coming right up."  
Mei "And I'll take a glass of Red Wine."  
Bartender "Got it."  

Narrator "As the bartender turned away, I leaned casually against the counter and glanced over at Mei."  
Narrator "Red Wine, as always?"  
Mei "She gave a little shrug, a small smile tugging at her lips."  
Mei "What can I say? I like what I like. It's dependable - like me."  
Narrator "I chuckled."  
Narrator "Nothing wrong with that." 
Narrator "Though I thought maybe tonight was the night you'd throw caution to the wind and order something wild."  
Mei "She raised an eyebrow, amused."  
Mei "If I wanted something wild, I wouldn't start with alcohol."  

Narrator "The bartender returned and placed our drinks in front of us."  
Narrator "I picked up my Whiskey Sour, the frothy top and citrus scent inviting."  
Narrator "I took a sip, letting the sweet and sour taste dance on my tongue before the smooth bite of the whiskey rolled in."  
Narrator "I sighed in delight."  

Narrator "Mei swirled her wine thoughtfully before taking a sip."  
Mei "So... you're going with a sour mood tonight?"  
Narrator "I smirked."  
Narrator "More like a bold mood." 
Narrator "Something with a little edge, but still smooth around the edges - like me."  
Mei "She laughed, shaking her head."  
Mei "You really just described a drink as your personality, huh?"  
Narrator "Guilty."  

Narrator "The bar around us buzzed softly with conversation and clinking glasses."  
Narrator "We fell into easy conversation, trading stories, laughs, and playful teasing between sips."  
Narrator "Time passed unnoticed, like the ice slowly melting in our glasses."  

Narrator "Eventually, Mei leaned back with a quiet sigh, her glass nearly empty."  
Mei "Well, Mister Smooth-And-Sour, it's getting late."  
Narrator "I nodded, finishing the last of my drink."  
Narrator "Come on, I'll walk you home."
