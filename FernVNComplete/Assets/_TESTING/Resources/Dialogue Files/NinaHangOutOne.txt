Narrator "Later that night, the conversation between Nina and I had softened as we finished our last drinks." 
Narrator "I noticed that Nina was a little buzzed, her steps slightly uneven as she stood from the bar stool." 
Narrator "You good?" 
Narrator "I stood beside her in case she fell." 
Nina "Yeah, I'm fine." 
Narrator "There was a slight slur in her words." 
Nina "Guess I had a little more than I realized." 
Narrator "Noticing the late hour and the way she swayed just a bit, I decided to..."

		Narrator "I ordered a Drift and stayed by her side, waiting for the driver." 
		Nina "Thanks... for tonight. I didn't really expect to talk to anyone, let alone... Everything else."  
		Narrator "She glanced at me, her lips curving into a small, sincere smile." 
		Narrator "Same." 
		Narrator "I leaned against a lamppost." 
		Narrator "But I'm glad we did. You're easy to talk to." 
		Narrator "Nina gave a half-laugh." 
		Nina "Not sure about that. I usually just ramble about art and life..." 
		Nina "I'm a bit of a mess." 
		Narrator "Well, it's better than being a pretender." 
		Narrator "It's refreshing to hear someone speak very honestly." 
		Narrator "Plus, everyone's got their messes... Shit, even I'm little bit of a mess, I'm just good at keeping it hidden." 
		Nina "Guess that's true." 
		Narrator "She paused, then her voice lowered a little." 
		Nina "You know, it's weird. I thought I would feel more... Awkward after everything, but this just feels... Natural." 
		Narrator "I have been told that I'm easy to talk to."  
		Narrator "I glanced down at my phone, checking the location of her Drift driver before turning back to her." 
		Narrator "By the way, do you use Picstagram? I would like to see some of your art... And, well, stay in touch." 
		Narrator "Nina blinked in surprise." 
		Nina "Yeah, I have one." 
		Nina "But I warn you - most of my posts are just pictures of half-finished paintings and my cat." 
		Narrator "Sounds like the best kind of content." 
		Narrator "She laughed." 
		Narrator "Nina pulled out her phone and opened the app, her thumb scrolling for a moment before she showed me her profile." 
		Narrator "After the exchange, the notification for the Drift ride popped up on my screen." 
		Narrator "Looks like your driver's almost here." 
		Narrator "Nina sighed, glancing down the street." 
		Nina "Well, I guess this is it... For tonight."  
		Narrator "As the car pulled up, I walked her to the door and opened it for her." 
		Narrator "She gave me one last smile before sliding into the backseat." 
		Narrator "Before, I knew it, the car faded into the darkness of the night." 
		Narrator "I started to walk back to the apartment." 
		Narrator "As I walked home, I couldn't help think about my time with Nina. There was something about her raw honesty. I like feel like she's someone on the edge of something." 
		Narrator "She's not just another artist. She's has a talent - a talent to turn pain into beauty, even if she hasn't fully realized yet." 
		Narrator "Whatever it was, she was a fighter, even if she didn't know it yet." 
		Narrator "Another thought came to mind - I probably should have gotten a ride for myself."
