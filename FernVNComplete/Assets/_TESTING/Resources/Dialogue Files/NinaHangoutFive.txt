Narrator "I knocked on her door, and she opened it slowly and quietly." 
Narrator "The hallway light framed her like a dim spotlight - tired eyes, tank top, wine bottle in hand."
Nina "Oh, hey $PlayerStats.FirstName. What are you doing here?"
FirstName "You texted me, telling me your power went out."
Nina "I did?"
Nina "Must've forgot..."
Nina "Want to come in?"
FirstName "Sure?"
Narrator "She opened the door fully, stepping aside with that usual shrug that always felt like an apology and an invitation rolled into one."
Narrator "Charcoal smudges stained her fingertips like bruises, and the bottle in her other hand tilted lazily, half-full and swaying like a pendulum."
Narrator "As I stepped inside, I was welcome by an overpowering scent of lavender, sandalwood, and something citrusy - a chaotic blend of mismatched scented candles was scattered around the apartment like forgotten stars."
FirstName "So, are we going to conduct a seance too?"
Narrator "She cracked a smile and closed the door behind me."
Nina "Maybe we are."
Narrator "She said jokingly."
Narrator "On the coffee table sat a half-finished sketch, an open sketchbook curling at the edges, a handful of color pencils, and another wine bottle."
Narrator "Books were stacked like towers, canvases leaning against the wall, and one of her boots lied on the kitchen counter for some reason."
Narrator "Nina was on the floor, sitting cross-legged on a cushion, drawing on a sketchpad that was on her lap, wine still in her hand."
FirstName "What happened to the power?"
Nina "Forgot to pay the electricity bill."
Nina "Silly me."
Narrator "I glanced at the kitchenette counter, where some unopened envelopes sat in a disheveled stack, stamped with bold, red letters reading 'PAST DUE.'" 
Narrator "A few were curled and a few were water stained."
Narrator "I raised an eyebrow, but I didn't say anything. Not yet."

{
	-Are You Going To Forget These Too?
		FirstName "Are you going to forget to pay these too?"
		Narrator "I gestured toward the stack of unpaid bills on the counter."
		Narrator "She didn't flinch, but her fingers curled more tightly around the wine bottle."
		Narrator "She sighed."
		Nina "It's not that I forgot, I just... I've been juggling things. Rent, food, art supplies."
		Nina "I've been struggling to catch up with the bills lately."
		Nina "I'm fine though, thanks for asking."
		Narrator "You don't seem fine."
		Nina "I am now."
		Narrator "She downs some wine then set the wine glass down gently beside her."
		Nina "I have wine."
		Nina "And candles."
		Nina "And now you, apparently."
		Narrator "The candlelight caught in her face, casting small red glows across her face like stained glass. She gave a soft, crooked grin, the kind that tried to be dismissive."

	-Having Money Trouble? 
		FirstName "Nina, are you having money trouble?"
		Narrator "I kept my tone soft, more concern than accusation."
		Nina "Couldn't afford the electric bill this month."
		FirstName "Why didn't you say anything?"
		Nina "It wouldn't have change anything." 
		Nina "People hear 'money problems' and suddenly you're a cautionary tale."
		Nina "And why give more reasons for people to think less of you?" 
		Nina "Once they start seeing the issues, they look at you differently - stop looking at you like a person. You become... A burden."
		FirstName "I'm not looking at you like that. I just want to know if there's something I can do."
		FirstName "Anything, really."
		Nina "You're already doing something. You're here." 
		Nina "And honestly, that's more than I expected from anyone tonight."
		Narrator "She didn't meet my eyes."

	-How've You Been? 
		FirstName "How've you been?"
		Narrator "I asked it gently."
		Nina "I'm whatever."
		Narrator "She said it with a shrug - the kind of answer you give when you're too tired to lie, but too proud to tell the truth."
		Narrator "I'm here if you ever need anything."
		Nina " Oh, sure. You can try to solve all my problems."
		Narrator "She said sarcastically."
		Nina "I'll be happy to give you the list. Color-coded. Prioritized. You can be my own personal disaster response assistant."
		Narrator "She sighs."
		Nina "... Sorry."
		Nina "I know I make it hard sometimes. To be around me, I mean."
		Nina "Thanks. For showing up. For asking. For... Not turning it into some big thing."
		FirstName "Not a problem."
		Nina "But just so you know - Don't make a habit of being understanding. Others might start expecting it."
}

FirstName "Why are drinking?" 
Nina "Emotional support."
Nina "Can't always rely on people."
Narrator "She swirled the bottle."
Nina "You know, I was upset about it at first but after a while, I started liking it."
Nina "There's something nice about this atmosphere."
Narrator "I sat beside her on the floor, careful not to knock over a candle."
Narrator "For a while, we just sat there. Saying nothing."
Narrator "I watched her sketched aimlessly on the paper in front of her. Her lines came in bursts - sharp and jagged one moment, delicate and ghost-like the next." 
Narrator "Her art always said more than her words."
FirstName "What are you trying to draw?"
Nina "Whatever comes to mind."
Narrator "She took a sip, and I noticed that her fingers held the bottle just a little too tightly."
Nina "... You know, when I was a kid, blackouts used to scare the hell out of me."
FirstName "Yeah?" 
Nina "I used to think the dark meant something was coming. Some shadow, some monster, something waiting." 
Nina "And sometimes it was just my dad yelling about the fuse box."
Nina "But now? I grew to like the dark. The stillness. No noise, no expectations. It's peaceful."
FirstName "That's why you're a night owl?"
Narrator "Just you, your thoughts and your work, with little to no disruptions."
Nina "And my wine."
Narrator "I looked at her, staring."
Narrator "I could tell that she was joking but I knew that it was only half a joke."
Narrator "She caught me staring her and sighed, setting the bottle down for the first time since I arrived."
Nina "Don't look at me like that."
Nina "Like you see something in me worth saving..."
Nina "I'm not broken, $PlayerStats.FirstName. I'm just... Tired."
FirstName "I didn't say you were."
Nina "But you thought it."
Nina "I know you did."
Nina "Sometimes, I think it too."
Narrator "I didn't answer right away."
Narrator "Instead, I picked up one of the candles and held it between us."
FirstName "Look, maybe I am thinking about you."
FirstName "But not like that. Not like you're some fragile thing."
Nina "Then how?"
FirstName "Like someone who's strong enough to sit with their demons in the dark and still invites someone else in."
Narrator "She blinked at me, and didn't retort with any sarcasm."
Nina "... Why are you nice and patient with me?"

choice "..." 
{
	-I Care About You
		FirstName "Because I care about you, Nina."
		Nina "People say that a lot."
		Nina "Usually when they want something from me."
		Nina "You want to fuck me? Is that it?"
		Nina "You want to fuck me, don't you, $PlayerStats.FirstName?"
		FirstName "No!"
		FirstName "I'm saying it because I mean it."
		FirstName "No conditions. No hidden agenda."
		Narrator "She leaned slightly in, looking at me, as if trying to detect a lie."
		Narrator "She then leaned back to her initial position."
		Nina "That's scary, you know. Caring makes things messy."
		Narrator "I nodded."
		FirstName "Yeah."
		FirstName "But it also makes things worth it."
		Nina "Maybe. If I don't mess it up."
		FirstName "Even if you do. I'll still care. That's kind of the point of caring."
		Narrator "She gave a shaky laugh, like it caught in her throat before it could become real."
		Nina "God. You're making it really hard to push you away right now."
		FirstName "Then don't."

	-I Want To Help You
		FirstName "Because I want to help you."
		Nina "I told you - I don't need saving."
		Nina "And why do even want to help me? Why do you even care?"
		Nina "To make yourself feel like a good person?"
		FirstName "Because I know what it's like to pretend you're OK when you're not."
		Narrator "She looked down at the candle between us. Her face was unreadable, but her hands - those always told the truth. Her left hand gripped the edge of her sketchpad while her right hand played with the hem of her shirt."
		Nina "You're not one of those 'fixer' types, are you?"
		Nina "You can't fix me. You know that, right?"
		FirstName "I don't want to fix you. I just want to be there for you."
		FirstName "To hold space for you, so you don't have to face the darkness alone."
		Narrator "She didn't answer right away."
		Narrator "Her sketchpad continued to sit on her lap, and she absently dragged the pencil across the page - a shape forming, then vanishing beneath a rough smudge."
		Narrator "She reached for her glass, then stopped. Her hand hovered in the air for a moment before falling back to her lap."
		Nina "If you really want to help, just... Stay. Not as a hero. Just as a friend."
		Narrator "I nodded."

	-I'm Your Friend
		FirstName "Because I'm your friend, Nina."
		Nina "You sure about that? You've seen me with candles, wine, overdue bills."
		Nina "You've seen me like this - candles instead of lights, wine instead of sleep, overdue bills I keep stacking, and surrounding myself in this abomination of scent."
		FirstName "Yes."
		FirstName "You're not the only person with issues, Nina."
		FirstName "And I'm still here, because that's what friends do."
		Nina "Friends also leave when things get inconvenient or messy."
		Nina "Or uncomfortable."
		Nina "Or just too damn much."
		FirstName "Then I'll be the exception. I won't walk away."
		FirstName "I'm not afraid of messes."
		Narrator "She watched me for a moment, like she wasn't sure whether to believe me or cry."
		Narrator "Her lip twitched - not quite a smile, not quite a frown."
		Nina "You're either really stubborn or stupid."
		FirstName "Better than being someone who lets you go through crap alone."
		Nina "... You're a good friend."
		Nina "Even if you're kinda dumb."
		Nina "And I'm sorry for trying to push you away before."
		Nina "... Thanks for coming. Even if I invited you and forgot about it."
		FirstName "Always."
		Narrator "Outside, the city was silent except for the distant hum of a train and the whisper of the wind against the windows."
		Nina "You know, this isn't so bad."
		FirstName "What isn't?"
		Nina "Inviting someone. Letting someone stay."
		Narrator "I didn't say anything. I just nodded."
		Nina "I don't want you to leave."
		Nina "Want to spend the night?"
}

choice "..."
{
	-Sure
		FirstName "Sure."
		FirstName "If that'll help you feel better. I'm in."
		Nina "OK... Just don't snore."
		FirstName "Only if you promise not to start sketching my face while I'm asleep."
		Nina "No promises."
		
		Narrator "One by one, we blew out the candles, their little flames vanishing into wisps of smoke that curled into the air."
		Narrator "We blew out the candles until the apartment sank into darkness."
		Narrator "She handed me an extra pillow, soft from use, and I settled onto the couch. It wasn't much, but it felt like enough."
		Narrator "The cushions were uneven, the blanket was thin, and the scent of melted wax still lingered in the air, but I didn't mind."
		Narrator "I closed my eyes, listening to the faint sounds of the occasional wind tapping the glass."
		Narrator "And somewhere in the stillness, I drifted off."

	-I Would But...
		FirstName "I would but..."
		Narrator "I watched her expression shift with a flicker of disappointment."
		FirstName "... I should probably head out before midnight."
		FirstName "I just need to be home in case I need to open the cafe tomorrow."
		Nina "OK. I understand."
		Narrator "Plus, I feel like if I stay too long... I don't know. We might do something that you'll probably regret later."
		Nina "You think I'm trying to seduce you with candles and overdue bills?"
		Narrator "Of course not."
		Narrator "Her voice was teasing, but not unkind."
		Narrator "I smiled."
		Narrator "One-by-one, we blew out the candles, their little flames vanishing into wisps of smoke that curled into the air."
		Narrator "We blew out the candles until the apartment sank into darkness."
		Narrator "She then walked me to the door without a word."
		Narrator "When we reached the door, she looked at me with a smile."
		Nina "Thanks for coming over. Really."
		Narrator "She didn't say much after that, but the way she lingered just a second longer before closing the door said enough."
		Narrator "I stepped out into the hall and walked out into night."
		Narrator "And I drove home through the quiet roads."
